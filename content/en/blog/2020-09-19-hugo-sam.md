There are several things you need to prepare to preview locally and deploy a Hugo site which uses the [Sam theme](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam). 

## Install Node.js, npm, postcss-cli, and autoprefixer

Victoria recommends installing Node.js and npm [this way](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). **However**, after the installation, when running `npm install -g postcss-cli` and `npm install -g autoprefixer` to install `postcss-cli` and `autoprefixer`, a permission error might occur:

```bash
Error: EACCES: permission denied, access '/usr/local/lib/node_modules'
```

[This thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48910876/error-eacces-permission-denied-access-usr-local-lib-node-modules) documented this problem. To solve it, simply follow [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59575266). 

The idea is, instead of installing `npm` through a Node installer, you can install it using `nvm`. 

1. Install `nvm`.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash
```

You can run the above line of code no matter what directory you are at. 

2. Install `Node.js` and `npm` via `nvm`.

```bash
nvm install stable
```

Then, you can install `postcss-cli` and `autoprefixer`. 

The following codes come from [this answer](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction/issues/210#issuecomment-645661326) on [this thread](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction/issues/210):

```bash 
sudo npm i -g postcss-cli
```

and

```bash
sudo npm i -g autoprefixer 
```

You will be asked to input your passwords. If you are using a Mac, your input will be invisible. However, it will be processed anyway. So don't worry. Just input your passwords and press `Enter`. 

## Locally preview the project
When previewing the website, Hugo might give this error:

```bash
TOCSS: failed to transform "css/main.tmp.css" (text/x-sass): resource "sass/sass/style.sass_7642ba43b3212fd7d7ba324df3b88b0c" not found in file cache
```

To solve this problem, simply copy the `/exampleSite/resources` and paste it into the root directory of your hugo project. 

## Deploy through Netlify
If you are deploying your project via Netlify:

First, don't use the `netlify.toml` within `hugo-theme-sam`. Instead, use the `netlify.toml` [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/). Be sure to edit the `HUGO_VERSION` accordingly. Put this `netlify.toml` file at the root directory of your Hugo project. 

```toml
 [build]
 publish = "public"
 command = "hugo --gc --minify"

 [context.production.environment]
 HUGO_VERSION = "0.75.1"
 HUGO_ENV = "production"
 HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"

 [context.split1]
 command = "hugo --gc --minify --enableGitInfo"

 [context.split1.environment]
 HUGO_VERSION = "0.75.1"
 HUGO_ENV = "production"

 [context.deploy-preview]
 command = "hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

 [context.deploy-preview.environment]
 HUGO_VERSION = "0.75.1"

 [context.branch-deploy]
 command = "hugo --gc --minify -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"

 [context.branch-deploy.environment]
 HUGO_VERSION = "0.75.1"

 [context.next.environment]
 HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"
```

The deployment might fail and give you this error:

```
Building sites â€¦ ERROR 2020/09/16 20:06:07 Transformation failed: POSTCSS: failed to transform "css/main.css" (text/css): PostCSS not found; install with "npm install postcss-cli". See https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/
```

This problem can be solved by [this answer](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction/issues/210#issuecomment-651869483). Simply add a `package.json` file at the root directory of your Hugo project. The `package.json` is to tell Netlify what packages are needed to deploy our Hugo projects: `postcss-cli` and `autoprefixer`. Although you have installed the two packages locally, Netlify doesn't know you will need them until you let it know. 

The `package.json` should be like this, as [mike-foucault](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-introduction/issues/210#issuecomment-651869483) suggested:

```json
{
  "name": "netlify-deps",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "postcss-cli": "7.1.1",
    "autoprefixer": "9.8.4"
  }
}
```

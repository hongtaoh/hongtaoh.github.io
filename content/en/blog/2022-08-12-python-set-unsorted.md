I just learned this several days ago: set in python is unsorted and changes from time to time. 

For example:

```python
a = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'e']
set(a)
```

If you run the codes twice (in two different notebooks or scripts), the results are different. To solve this problem:

```py
list(set(a)).sort()
```

After clicking "Buy Now", you'll see in "Total" that the price is much higher than it should be. This is because Amazon chooses the default shipping method which charges around $8 even though the stuff you are purchasing should include **free shipping**. 

What should we do then?

Click the first row which says "Arriving ...", and from there, choose "FREE Shipping".

Lesson learned: **Never be deceiful as Amazon**.

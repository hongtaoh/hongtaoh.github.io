# ACC-Automated Car Following Model

ACC is short for "Adaptive cruise control". It is a control model based on acceleration. It has the following formula:

`$$a_{AV} (t) = k_1 (g(t) - \tau v_{AV}(t)) + k_2 \Delta v$$`

## Functions

- `$a_{AV} (t)$`: function of the acceleration of the ACC vehicle (which is following another vehilce), with respect to time
- `$g(t)$`: function of the gap between the two vehicles (the position of the preceeding vehicle minus that of the ACC vehicle) with respect to time
- `$v_{AV}(t)$`: function of the ACC vehicle's speed with respect to time. 

## Parameters

- `$k_1 = 0.23 s^{-2}$` (What does `$s^{-2} mean?$`)
- `$k_2 = 0.07 s^{-1}$`
- `$\tau$`, safety time gap between the two vehicles

## Example

Let's consider the following example:

>The preceding vehicle is cruising at 30m/s speed for the first 10 seconds, then decreasing to `$10 m/s$` with deceleration `$−2𝑚/𝑠^2$` and then accelerating to 30m/s with acceleration `$2𝑚/𝑠^2$`. The initial speed of the following ACC vehicle is 30m/s. 

>`$\tau = 1.1s$`

>Initial spacing is `$20m$`

Based on the above settings, we want to plot the trajectory of the two vehhicles. 


```julia
using Plots
```


```julia
# Planned Trajectory
v_cruise = 30 # m/s
t_cruise = 10 # first 10 seconds
a_decel = -2   # m/s^2
a_accel = 2    # m/s^2
init_space = 50 # initial spacing is 50 m
init_acc_v = 30 # initial acc speed is 20 m/s

k1 = 0.23
k2 = 0.07 

# speed when deceleration stops
v_decel_end = 10

# how much time the preceeding vehicle decelerates
t_decel = (v_cruise - v_decel_end)/abs(a_decel) 

# speed when deceleration stops
v_accel_end = 30

# how much time the preceeding vehicle accelerates
t_accel = (v_accel_end - v_decel_end)/abs(a_accel) 

time_interval = 0.2
time_span = 0.0:time_interval:30

safety_time_gap = 1.1
```

## What I do not understand

1. [Google Sheets for ACC](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kSeWdyDF1gnNNEwKFBN29zWzcyX7k-B9Sc0zWvZcRpo/edit#gid=1630639848)

2. [Google Sheets for PID](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rYf5kZiMirUJiOOgMYzvGVHzhcNX72qXp2s-rhQdn4c/edit#gid=304110156)

- k1, k2
- how to calculate x_av
- responsive planning, how to calculate a_ac
- how to always keep the safety time gap
- how to get the exact distance (x_av) function w.r.t time for ac? I know probably we need to use calculs again. But it's difficult because we need v_av in the function of x_av, and we need a_av in the function of v_av. However, we need v_av also in the function of a_av

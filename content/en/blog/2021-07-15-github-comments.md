Sometimes, I want to go back to the issues where I commented. How to find those issues?

@Toolkit provides [a detailed answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43966955/13716814). Take me for example, simply search [`commenter:hongtaoh`](https://github.com/search?q=commenter%3Ahongtaoh) in the GitHub search box. Click the dropdown of "Sort: Best match" to choose other sorting methods. 

To make sure all the results are issues, use [`is:issue commenter:hongtaoh`](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+commenter%3Ahongtaoh).

Thanks, @Toolkit.

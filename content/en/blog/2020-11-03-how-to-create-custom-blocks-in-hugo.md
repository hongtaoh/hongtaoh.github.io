I thought creating custom blocks in Hugo would be difficult. But with Hugo's shortcode, and [the CSS](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/blob/master/inst/examples/css/style.css) from Yihui Xie's [Bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) project, it can be super easy. 

# Download images and edit stylesheet

First of all, you'll need to download five images from [here](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/tree/master/inst/examples/images): `caution`, `important`, `note`, `tip`, and `warning.png`. Add these images to the `static` folder of your Hugo project. I suppose you are add them to the root directory of `static`. 

Then, in your `CSS` stylesheet, add the following:

```css
.note,
.important,
.tip,
.caution,
.warning {
  min-height: 2.2em;
  padding: 1em 1em 0.1em 4em;
  background: #f5f5f5 2px top/3em no-repeat;
} 
.note {
  background-image: url("../note.png");
}
.important {
  background-image: url("../important.png");
}
.tip {
  background-image: url("../tip.png");
}
.caution {
  background-image: url("../caution.png");
}
.warning {
  background-image: url("../warning.png");
}
```

Edit the styles as you need. For example, you can use a different font or `font-size` for texts in your custom blocks. If you don't know how to do so, you probably need to [learn more about CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/). 

Also, `background: #f5f5f5 2px top/3em no-repeat;` means that the image will appear on the top-left corner. If you want it to be at the left-center, change that line of code to `background: #f5f5f5 2px center/3em no-repeat;`

# Create shortcode

Then, we are going to create shortcodes for custome blocks. 

Create a shortcode named "block" (or any name you want) with the following code:

```
<div {{ with .Get "class" }}class="{{.}}"{{ end }}>
```

And another shortcode named "end" (or any other name you want) with the following code:

```
</div>
```

Super easy, right?

# Write in between shortcodes
{{< block class="note" >}}
This is a note.
{{< end >}}

is generated by:

{{&lt;  block class=&quot;note&quot;  &gt;}} </br>
This is a note. </br>
{{&lt; end &gt;}}

The same is for important, tip, caution and warning. 

{{< block class="important" >}}
This is important!
{{< end >}}

{{< block class="tip" >}}
This is a tip. How much are you going to tip me?
{{< end >}}

{{< block class="caution" >}}
Caution: Great food ahead! Don't go if you are on a diet.
{{< end >}}

{{< block class="warning" >}}
Warning: Road blocked ahead!
{{< end >}}

I personally like use this quite often:

{{< block class="reminder" >}}
You can use this whatever way you like. I usually use it to remind myself something in a post. 
{{< end >}}

If you like it too, you can download the image [here](http://gdut_yy.gitee.io/doc-csstdg4/ch1.html#_1-6-feature-queries), and then add the following to your stylesheet (edit as you need):

```css
.reminder {
  min-height: 3.2em;
  padding: 1em 1em 1em 4em;
  background: #f5f5f5 2px center/3em no-repeat;
  background-image: url("../reminder.png");
}
```

You don't have to use the name of `reminder`. Use any name you want.

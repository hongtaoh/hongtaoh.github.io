Suppose you have a folder named `A` within Desktop. The `A` folder has the following structure:

```
├── B
│   ├── D
│   │   ├── E
│   │   │   ├── F
│   │   │   │   ├── G
│   │   │   │   │   └── g.md
│   │   │   │   └── f.md
│   │   │   └── e.md
│   │   └── d.md
│   └── b.md
├── C
│   └── c.md
└── a.md
```

## Task 1: Copy `C/c.md` and paste it to `B`

First, change directory to `A` using `cd Desktop/A`. 

Then, 

```bash
cp C/c.md B
```

This is quite easy to do.

## Task 2: Copy `C/c.md` and paste it to the root of A

Use a dot, `.`, to represent the root directory of where are currently at. 

```bash
cp C/c.md .
```

## Task 3: Copy the `E` folder and paste it to the root of A

Use `cp -r` or `cp -R`.

```bash
cp -r B/D/E .
```

## Task 4: Copy all the contents within `E` and paste them to the root of A

The key point here is that you are asked to copy the **contents** within `E`, not `E` itself. Use `/*` to represent all the contents within a folder:

```bash
cp -r B/D/E/* .
```

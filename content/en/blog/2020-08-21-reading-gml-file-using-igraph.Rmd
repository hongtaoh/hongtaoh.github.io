You can read the official documentation on `read_graph()` [here](https://igraph.org/r/doc/read_graph.html) for more info. Be sure to **put the file name in between quotation marks**. For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(igraph)
read_graph("lesmiss.gml", format = "gml")
```

For more information on how to read local files, refer to [this post](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2018/02/27/r-file-paths/).

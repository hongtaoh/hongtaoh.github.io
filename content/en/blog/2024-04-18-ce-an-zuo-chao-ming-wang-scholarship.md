>How do you plan to contribute to the field of Computer Science or Statistics in your future career? (300 word count)

As a PhD student in Computer Sciences with a background in liberal arts and social sciences, I aim to contribute to the field by (1) showcasing that it is possible to conduct computer science research even if you are from a non-STEM background; (2) democratizing technical skills through tutorials tailored to non-experts. I am convinced that knowledge in programming and artificial intelligence should be accessible to all, rather than only a talented few. 

Despite the widespread interest in artificial intelligence and computer programming, individuals from non-STEM backgrounds may be intimidated by the engineering and math requirements. This hinders the diversity of computer science research. I hope my academic journey and personal experiences can inspire those individuals to explore opportunities they deemed as impossible before. Diversity in the field can foster unique perspectives and unconventional solutions to a variety of technical and social challenges we face today. 

I attempt to democratize machine learning and computer science skills through a bilingual blog. I routinely create tutorials in both Chinese and English tailored to those from non-STEP backgrounds. These guides are designed to help them build personal websites, analyze and visualize data, use git, build curriculum vitae, learn and apply linear algebra and calculus, and understand machine learning basics. Although there are many resources online, only a limited number of them cater to those transitioning from non-technical disciplines. 

An example of my impact is inspiring a social science graduate from China, who, motivated by my story and blog posts, successfully obtained admission to the Oxford Internet Institute. My goal is to keep creating content that empowers a broader audience to engage with and contribute to the field of computer science.

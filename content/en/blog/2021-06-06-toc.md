I found [the answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42249534) by M. Geiger very helpful. 

First, you need to have [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) installed. 

Let's say you have this markdown file: `README.md`. To generate table of contents for this file, first go to its directory, then run the following in your Terminal:

```bash
pandoc -s --toc README.md -o README-TOC.md
```

- `-s` means "standalone". 

- `--toc` means including an automatically generated table of contents in the output document. 

- `-o` means "output".

You may also include `--toc-depth=NUMBER`. NUMBER here can be anything from 1-6. The default is 3, which means level-1, 2, and 3 headings will be included in the table of contents. 

For more information, consult [Pandoc Userâ€™s Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).

## What if I don't want level-1 heading to be included?

Simply comment it out before generating the table of contents.

TED talks say that they have ideas worth spreading, but I am not sure whether those ideas are worth listening. 

Many people really like TED talks. These talks were and possibly still are very popular among Chinese students who regard TED talks as a valuable resource to learn English. In this aspect, I agree. TED is very helpful for English learners like me[^1]. After all, most of the speakers are native speakers and their talks are very good for learners to practice listening and speaking. 

However, in terms of wisdom value of these talks, I have so many doubts. I don't think they have much wisdom in them.

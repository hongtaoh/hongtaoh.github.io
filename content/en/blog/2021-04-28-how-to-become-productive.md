We had a fruitful discussion on this topic in [YY's](http://yongyeol.com/) writing group on 2021-04-22. I'll recap the main points discussed. 

Overall, it's a journal of knowing yourself. 

## Some key tips:

- Keep healthy physically and mentally: sleep well, sleep well, and exercise. Without good health, all tips fail. 

- Prioritize. Know what's the most important for you. 

- Track your time. Manage time well. 

- Do weekly, monthly, seasonal, and yearly review. 

- Create environments/conditions to force yourself to concentrate. For example, block social media websites. 

- Singe-tasking: do one thing at a time. 

- 20/80 rule. If you need 1 unit of time to make a project perfect. To complete 80% of this project, you only need 0.2 unit of time. Therefore, complete the majority of the project quickly and maybe let others perfect it. 

- Make visible progress on a daily basis that can boost your confidence. For example, I am reading papers every day and posting my summaries of them. 

- Avoid unnecessary meetings. Meeting should be quick decision-making process. 

## Some books recommended:

- *Get Things Done* by David Allen

- *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg

- *Atomic Habits* by Jame Clear

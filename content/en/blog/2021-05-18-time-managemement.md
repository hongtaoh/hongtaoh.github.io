In YY's Writing Group of 2021-05-17, we talked about time management. Here are some points mentioned in the group:

## Block of time

To push through hard problems, it's necessary to reserve a big chunk of time. YY recommends using a calendar (any decent calendar is Okay) to reserve "meetings with yourself". These meetings should be blocks of time and are supposed to be regular. For example, you reserve 9-11 am every day. 

Every time people ask you to do something together during these "meetings with yourself", you can say no. 

## Prioritization

Know what's the most important thing to do. Get them done one by one. 

## Exercise. Keep healthy. 

Do exercise regularly. Keep fit. You won't get anything done unless you are healthy and happy. 

## Single-tasking

Focus on one thing at a time.

## Track your time

Professor YY recommends [Toggl](https://toggl.com/). When you track your time, you can compile weekly/monthly/seasonal/yearly reviews so that you know whether you are spending too much or too little time on something. 

## Books

I updated two of my [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) projects but found that I was not able to compile the LaTeX. The warning message says:

{{<block class="warning">}}
! LaTeX3 Error: Mismatched LaTeX support files detected. 

Loading 'expl3.sty' aborted!

The L3 Programming layer in the LaTeX format is dated 2020-12-03, but in your TeX tree the files require at least 2020-12-07. 
{{<end>}}

As follows:

I found the solution in Yihui's [TinyTeX documentation](https://bookdown.org/).

Open a new R Script, and input the following two lines of codes:

```r
library(tinytex)
tlmgr_update()
```

The above error might be due to `expl3`'s [update](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/expl3) on 2020-12-07.

Hope it helps.

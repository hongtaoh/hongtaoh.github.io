First, enter this in your command line if you are using a Mac:

```bash
open -a Finder ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels
```

You'll see `kernels -> julia-XX`. For example, `kernels -> julia-1.6`. Open the `julia-1.6`, you'll see `kernel.json`. Open it. As Bogumi≈Ç recommended, add `"COLUMNS": "1000", "LINES": "100"` to the `env` variable. 

Then, restart your Jupyter Notebook.

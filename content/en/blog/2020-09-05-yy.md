I've learned so much from Professor [Yong-Yeon ("YY") Ahn](http://yongyeol.com/). Aside from knowledge and skills[^1], I learned how to get along with (my future) students, find a job after a PhD, and be a good scholar and a good person. 

I thought about writing this blog after the Zoom meeting yesterday where he shared his experience about finding a job after PhD or a post-doc. I'll first summarize what I leared during that meeting and then talk about what I leared from him previously. 

## What I Learned from the Zoom Meeting, Professor YY's Advice on How to Spend Your Five Years as A PhD student

### On Research

#### Write Your Research Statement Early on

I guess a *research statement*[^2] is more or less similar to a *statement of purpose* when we apply for PhD positions. I mentioned this analogy and Professor YY told me that they are a little different. For example, in a research statment, you need to specify how you can contribute to the diversity and development of the department you are applying to, and also to societal good, but you don't necessarily have to do this for a statement of purpose.

Around *research statements*, Professor YY said that you need to start writing it early on, as this will help you see the bigger academic picture more clearly. What does a *big academic picture* mean? If I remember it correctly, Professor YY suggested that when you are focusing on your individual research projects, you can easily forget about where you stand among others. However, research statements will remind you of your location in that big picture. This way, you will be more aware of where you are heading, and what's your contribution to the scientific community. The clearly you know about your contribution, the higher chances of finding a position. 

#### Be A World-class Expert in Your Chosen Field

Professor YY also said that as a scholar, you need to have **expertise**. You should be able to make distinct contributions to the scientific community you are in. You are **the one** to ask when people have questions regarding the issue(s) you are doing research on. 


#### Have Two or Three Areas While Maintaining A Focus

You never know what research will help you find a job when you graduate. Before finding his current job, Professor YY did research on epidemiology, network science, and some computational biology. It is network science that helped him land a job at Indiana University. 

Even though it's better to have more than one area, you should have a focus. The best situation is that you are these two or three areas are around this **focus**. 

### On Grants and Publication

#### Applying for Grants, No Matter How Impossible You Think It Is for You to Get Them

In a group conrrespondence, Professor YY said that he wouldn't have had any grants if he only applied when he thought he was able to get it. Of special note, Professor YY got the [2014 Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/faculty-fellowship/#!fellows), which, he mentioned briefly that sent him an envelop that has a huge check. Keep applying for grants and fellowships, and you'll someday get one. 

I have personal confirmation to this advice. In the Slack group, Professor YY encourage group members to apply for NetSci2020, so I applied. I didn't have even a slice of expectation that I'll get it: I applied one day after the deadline, didn't know the filed, and didn't have any papers to present. However, one month after I submitted the application, I received an email telling me that I was selected for a *full* fee waiver, which saved me around $200. 

As Professor YY said, when you try, you still have some chance to get it, no matter how unlikely it seems. When you don't try, it's 100% sure that you are not going to get it. 

#### Have Some Exceptionally Good Publications

If all of your publications are good, such that they all get published in *Science*, *Nature*, or *PNAS*, good for you! Chances are you won't be able to do it. That said, Professor YY said you can't have so-so publications only. Some of your publications need to stand out. 

#### Collaborate with Other Scholars

If you are the first author, or worst, sole author, in all of your publications, search committee might get the sense that you are an asshole: not willing or being able to get along with others. That might hurt your chances of getting hired. It's best that you have first author papers but also second or third author papers. 

#### Publish Consistently

After your first publication, it's best if you can keep publishing at least one paper each year. This will send the signal that you are consistant. If you have papers published in the first year, no papers in the second and third year, and two or three papers in the fourth year, people reading your CV will feel you are inconsistent. 

#### Aim High

If you read Professor YY's [CV](http://yongyeol.com/cv.pdf), you'll know that he has publications in *Science*, *Nature*, *PNAS*, and *Lancet*. He mentions that you should aim high in research. He was quite humble to say that many times he felt surprised that his research got accepted by high-level journals. 

For me, and I guess for a lot of other scholars, it is quite the opposite. We feel that our work should get accepted but they didn't. 

Professor YY didn't say that but I learned from this that no matter how great you are as a scholar, keep foolish and humble. 

#### Ask for Help

People are nice. You'll get some help if you ask for it. Professor YY mentioned that when he was applying for the Microsoft Fellowship, he emailed receipients of previous years asking for their application statements. He did get them. So when you need others' help, don't lock yourself in your own room. Shoot emails to people you think can give you some help. 

I guess this applies not only to academia, but also to life. 

### On Networking

#### Attend Conferences 

A lot of times, people get hired by someone who talked with you, listened to your presentation, or simply saw your work on a conference. Therefore, do attend academic conference, talk to people, and prepare for each of your presentations well. 

#### Work with Different Professors and Get Their Refference Letters

You need up to several referene letters when you apply for academic or postdoc positions. In order to have strong letters, you need to work with different professors so they'll get to know more about you. 

Reference letters weigh a lot. To have a strong letter, these professors need concrete, convicing and specific evidence to demonstrate your ability. If you don'w work with them, they won't be able to write good and strong letters for you. 

Also, the more reference letter, the better. 

### On Teaching

It's beneficial if you can work as a teaching assistant[^3] for at least once. This will give you a sense of teaching. If you really hate teaching, you might want to reconsider whether you want to be a professor. Although research is the most important, especially if you find a job at a research oriented institution, teaching will account for a big chunk of your sense of accomplishment. If you don't like teaching, you'll hate your job as a professor. 

## What I Learned Previously

### Be Patient with Students

Students ask *"stupid"* questions and I did it on his [Data Visualization](http://yyahn.com/dviz-course/) class. His Dataviz class is very challenging. For me, each assigment costs me on average a whole day. Many times, I got very angry with the class and Prof. YY. I saw that someone was also complaining about the Dataviz course on Slack this past Summer in the Slack group[^4]. I could tell that, at least he was as impatient and angry as I was. 

However, as patient and nice as he was last year when replying to my angry words on Slack, Professor YY replied to that student very nicely. 

Looking back, I felt so fortunate to have taken Professor YY's Data Visualization class. That was my first experience of using Python and I learned a very important skill, i.e., visualize data. 

### Be Humble

I mentioned this above. Althought Professor YY have papers published in top journals, he was very humble. I learned a lot from this.

[^2]: I found an example of research statement [here](http://haewoon.io/PDFs/haewoon_research_statement.pdf), which might be helpful for you. 
[^3]: Here at IU, we called a teaching assistant as *graduate assistant* (do not lead lectures) and *associate instructors* (do lead lectures, as the name suggests).
[^4]: Professor YY usually communicates with students on Slack.

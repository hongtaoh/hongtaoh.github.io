Thanks to [Li-Wen Yip](https://github.com/liwenyip)'s [hugo-easy-gallery](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery/), it's relatively easy to create galleries inside a hugo post. 

Please follow the instructions regarding [Installation](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery/#installation) and [Theme integration](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery/#theme-integration).

For me, I added the codes in [Theme integration](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery/#theme-integration) to `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html`

1. figure.html

First, there is something to change in the shortcode of `figure.html` if you want to add the `width` parameter when inserting a figure. 

Change 

```html
<img itemprop="thumbnail" src="{{ $thumb | relURL }}" {{ with .Get "alt" | default (.Get "caption") }}alt="{{.}}"{{ end }}/>

```
to

```html
<img itemprop="thumbnail" {{ with .Get "width" }}width="{{.}}"{{ end }} src="{{ $thumb | relURL }}" {{ with .Get "alt" | default (.Get "caption") }}alt="{{.}}"{{ end }}/>
```

Basically, we added `{ with .Get "width" }}width="{{.}}"{{ end }}`.

2. hugo-easy-gallery.css

First, if you want to delete the horizontal line beneath each figure you inserted with the `<figure>` shortcode, comment out the part of `figure a`. 

Second, if you want to change the size of each figure within the gallery, edit `@media only screen and (min-width : 480px)`. Tweak the `width` and `padding-bottom` parameter. For example, try changing them to `25%` and `25%`, respectively. 

Third, if you want to decrease the white space between figures when you use the `<gallery>` shortcode, add `margin-left` and `margin-right` within `.gallery .box {}`. 

Fourth, if you want the gallery to be full width or simply become wider. Comment out `max-width: 768px;` within `.gallery{}` and add 

```css
.gallery{
  width: 100vw;
  position: relative;
  left: 50%;
  right: 50%;
  margin-left: -50vw;
  margin-right: -50vw;
}
```
Tweak `width`, `margin-left` and `margin-right` as you would like.

[This tutorial](https://iu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Kaltura+MediaSpace+09A+Downloading+Your+Videos/1_ik8360mm/54520851) by Zach Watt perfectly addresses this question:.

To summarize:

1. Log into your Kaltura account. 
2. Click your name in the right corner of the web page and select "my media" in the drop list. 
3. On the right of each video, there are three options (at least that's the case on 2021-08-05): view analytics, edit, and delete. Select "edit".
4. Under the "Downloads" tab, select "Source File", and click "Save"
5. Click "Go To Media"
6. Under the "Download" tab, you can download the video directly.

For beginners, whichever programming language you are learning, it might be difficult to differentiate the difference between `if` statements and `while` loop. In this blog post, I'll take Python and Javascript as examples to illustrate the differences between the two. 

Both statements are made up of two parts:

1. Condition statement; and 
2. Conditional code. 

Conditional code will be execuated only if the condition statements are true. 

Okay, those are the similaries. What about the differences? The major difference is that in an `if` statement, the conditional code will be execuated only once and then computers move on to the next, just like life does. However, in a `while` loop, after the conditional code is execuated, computers will go back to the **original** statement and assess it. This means that **in a `while` loop, if the conditional code does not change validity of the condition statement, the loop will keep going forever**, while, at least until your computer runs out of battery. 

Let's say we have this dataset: `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15]` and we want to know how many number are there that are greater than `$10$`. 

Let's do it with Python first. 

```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15]
num_gl_10 = 0
for n in a:
    if n > 10:
        num_gl_10 += 1
print(num_gl_10) #Expected output: 3
```

I used a `for` loop that iterates over the list of `a`. For every number in the list, the computer will first check whether it is greater than `$0$`. If yes, `$1$` will be added to `num_gl_10`, which has an initial value of `$0$`. If not, the `for` loop will let the next number to be assessed (against the `if` condition), until all the numbers are assessed. 

The logic of the `if` statement within the `for` loop is just like this:

The *condition* here is `if n > 10`, and the *conditoinal code* here is `num_gl_10 += 1`.

Similarly, we can do this with Javascript:

```js
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15];
let num_gl_10 = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
  if (a[i] > 10) {
     num_gl_10 = num_gl_10 + 1;
  };
};
```

The logic is the same as the Python script, only that in Javascript, `a` here is called an **array**, not a list. 

What if we change the `if` statement to be a `while loop`? It will be a disaster. 

In Python:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15]
num_gl_10 = 0
for n in a:
    while n > 10:
        num_gl_10 += 1
print(num_gl_10)
```
For the first number, i.e., `$1$`, it will be assessed agains the condition first. Since it is smaller than 10, it won't even get to the *conditional code*. Then the `for` loop will let the next number to be assessed. When the assessed number becomes `12`, all things are changed, just like the world is during the coronavirus. 

Since `$12$` is greater than `$10$`, `$1$` will be added to `num_gl_10`. However, different than in a `if` statement, our computer will assess `$12$` against the *condition* again, and, of course, execuate the *conditional code* again. It will keeps doing this until our computer runs out of battery. Why? Because that's the logic of a `while` loop:

It will happen in Javascript as well:

```js
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15];
let num_gl_10 = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
  while (a[i] > 10) {
     num_gl_10 = num_gl_10 + 1;
  };
};
```

When should we use a `while` loop then? As I said in the beginning of this post, we use it if the *conditional code* will change the validity of the *condition*.

I attended the writing group led by [YY](https://yongyeol.com/) on September 22, 2022 where YY, Vincent Wong, and I attended. The topic is "How to stay positive and have confidence in academia". The following are some of the key points:

- Don't compare yourself with others. I know this is cliche but it's difficult as well as important to do. There will always be super stars around you. If you keep comparing yourself with them, you will be negative and loss confidence. In fact, everyone has his or her own way of living and there is no way to make others your reference point. 

- Have trust in time. Keep working and you will achieve something maybe later. 

- Look outside of academia. If you only think about stuff in academia, you will think that is the only world in existance. But that is not the case. Academia is only a small fraction of the real world. Doing an internship may help you to see what is beyong academia. 

- Get things donw. Make concrete progress. These will give you concrete confidence day by day.

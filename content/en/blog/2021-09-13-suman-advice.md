Professor [Suman Banerjee](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/) came to the TA training of the [CS Depertment of UW-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) in August 2021. He came to the hall in a space suit, reminding us to "shoot for the stars". The following is my summary of his advice. 

1. Forget about GPA. Focus on your skills. 

2. Learning math never hurts. 

3. Go to as many talks & seminars as you possibly can. 

4. Be broad. Don't set limitations to yourself. 

5. Explore. Have fun. Graduate school is not only about study. 

6. Practice your time management skills. 

7. Collaborate. 

8. Communicate with your graduate student peers and your professors. 

9. Improve your communication skills: speaking & writing. 

10. Most importantly, aim high and shoot for the stars.

I found the output of Inscape is not optimal. [svg2pdf.js](https://github.com/yWorks/svg2pdf.js/) is much better!

First, download inkscape. Then run this code in your Terminal

```
ln -s /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/MacOS/inkscape \
      /usr/local/bin/inkscape
```

The source of the above code is: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22085247

After running the above snippet, you should be able to call inkscape from the command line. 

Then:

```
inkscape --export-filename=out.pdf in.svg
```

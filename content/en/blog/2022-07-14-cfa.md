Below are some of my notes on the key cutoff values for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). They are based on [this PDF](https://www.lesahoffman.com/CLP948/CLP948_Lecture04_CFA.pdf) by Professor [Lesa Hoffman](https://www.lesahoffman.com/).

  - Smaller chi square, and larger `$p$`-value are better (we don't want the p-value to be smaller than .05)

  - SRMR (smaller is better; <.08 -> good fit)

  - RMSEA, smaller is better. <.05 or <.06 -> good; .05~.08 -> acceptable; .08~.10 -> mediocre; >.10 -> unacceptable

  - CFI (Comparative Fit Index): bigger is better. >.90 -> acceptable; >.95 good

  - TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index): bigger is better, >.95 -> good

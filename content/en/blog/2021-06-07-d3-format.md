To remove insignificant trailing zeros, use `~%`. For example:

```js
d3.format("~%")(0.010) // "1%"
```

To have rounded percentages, we need to `.0%`, `.1%`, `.2%`, etc, depending on how many numbers do you want after the percentage sign:

```js
d3.format(".0%")(0.015) // "2%"
d3.format(".1%")(0.015) // "1.5%"
d3.format(".2%")(0.015) // "1.50%"
```

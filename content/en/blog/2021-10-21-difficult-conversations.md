The following is my notes on a talk given by Dr. [Shalini Nag](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-shalini-nag-talent-advisor).

More than 40 people attended this workshop. The very fact that other people also encounter difficult conversations makes me feel relieved.

- From conflict to collaboration. 

- Conflict is not necessarily negative. It becomes negative when you don't solve it. 

- Conflict is not necessarily disagreements. It might be simply incompatibility. 

- Don't avoid difficult conversations. 

- Differences do not result in conflicts. Can you find a win-win solution?

- Try to find a win-win. If you can't, take best actions you can. 

- Focus on outcomes, not positions. Try to get the outcomes of both parties, rather than proving you are right. 

- Look at the world through others' lens.

- Define the desired outcomes: What do you really want? Dig deeper! Be clear about what you want.

- Many times, you think it will be a difficult conversation but it's not from the stand point of other people.

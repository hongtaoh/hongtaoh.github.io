# PID controller

PID is short for "Proportional-Integral-Derivative". What it does is that if you have a planned trajectory for a vehicle which is now at a specific location and have a specific initial speed, PID will allow this vehicle to get to the planned trajectory. You accomplish this through PID by tweaking the three parameters:

- `$k_P$` 
- `$k_I$`
- `$k_D$`

If you multiply `$k_P$` by the distance between the planned location and the actual location at any timestamp, you get `$a_P$`. If you multiply `$k_I$` by the difference between the integral of the planned location and that of the actual location at any timestamp, you get `$a_I$`.  If you multiply `$k_D$` by the speed difference between the planned trajectory and the actual vehicle at any timestamp, you get `$a_D$`.

If you add up `$a_P$`, `$a_I$`, and `$a_D$`, you get `$a$`, which is the acceleration for the actual vehicle. 

## PID for constant speed

>The planned trajectory starts from location 0 at time 0. It is cruising at 30m/s speed for 50 seconds.The actual location is 3 at time 0 and the actual speed is 28m/s at time 0.


```julia
using Plots, Distributions, Random
```


```julia
function get_data(t, k_p=2, k_i=0, k_d=1)
    # initial state
    # y for the planned vehicle, x for the actual vehicle
    
    y = 0 # position
    int_y = 0 # integral of position
    y_dot = 30 # speed
    x = 3
    int_x = 0
    x_dot = 28
    
    a_p = k_p * (y - x)
    a_i = k_i * (int_y - int_x)
    a_d = k_d * (y_dot - x_dot)
    
    a = a_p + a_i + a_d
    
    # if time is 0, return the initial state
    if t == 0
        return (y, x)
    else
        for i in time_delta:time_delta:t
            # 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, ...
            x_dot_prev = x_dot
            x_dot += a * time_delta
            # THIS IS USING APPROXIMATION!
            x += 0.5*(x_dot_prev + x_dot) * time_delta
            int_x += x * time_delta

            # update y
            y_dot = y_dot # constant speed at all time
            y += y_dot * time_delta
            int_y += y * time_delta

            # update a_p, a_i, a_d, and a for usage at next timestamp
            a_p = k_p * (y - x)
            a_i = k_i * (int_y - int_x)
            a_d = k_d * (y_dot - x_dot)
            a = a_p + a_i + a_d
        end

## Dynamic speed (with random noise)

>The planned trajectory starts from location 0 at time 0. It is cruising at 30m/s speed for the first 10 seconds, then decreasing to 10 m/s with deceleration `$-2𝑚/𝑠^2$` for 10 seconds and then accelerating to 30m/s with acceleration `$2𝑚/𝑠^2$` for 10 seconds, and then cruising at 30 m/s for 20 seconds.

>The actual location is 3 at time 0 and the actual speed is 28m/s at time 0.

>Assuming the acceleration cannot be precisely controlled, and always has a random error uniformly distributed over `$[-0.2, 0.2] m/s$`


```julia
function get_y_dot(t)
    """This function gets the speed of the planned vehicle
    """
    if t <= 10

## Questions

- In pid, the x/y_dot, and int_y/x is using approximation, can we get the exact form?

It's very difficult to get the analytical form. 

- How to get the optimal value

It's also very difficult. It involves non-linear programming.

I saw [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65603434) on Stackoverflow. [This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70575716) is mostly correct but it omits lots of details. For example, I don't have a `.zshrc` file in the begining, how do I create it first. After entering `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`, how do I save and exit?

This post is to help solve this problem. 

First of all, open your Terminal. If you don't have a `.zshrc` file, input 

```
touch .zshrc
```

Then, input 

```
nano .zshrc
```

After openning `.zshrc`, copy and past 

```
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

Then, press `control` + `O`, then press `Eenter`, then press `control` + `X`. 

Then, in terminal, input 

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then, you can check whether `brew` in your path variable by 

```
brew version
```

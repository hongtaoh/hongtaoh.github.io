I knew about this event only three days before it occurred. Luckily, Maria, one of the organizers, emailed me that I could still register. I did and it only cost $25 for students.


On the first day of this event, I got up at around 4 AM and drove from Madison to Chicago. After I arrived, I parked at a nearby place and walked to the Logan center for the arts, where the event was held.

The breakfast was more than what I expected!

The first speaker was Ben Zhao. I knew him and previously read his posts on Quora. His talk was amazing. I also agree that helping creative artists protect their works from AI corporations is a meaningful undertaking. A fun fact: I always thought he is a Chinese American and cannot speak Chinese. It [turns out to be wrong](https://www.quora.com/Does-Professor-Ben-Y-Zhao-think-of-himself-as-a-Chinese-person).


I met a lot of peers. Talking to them is always helpful and inspiring to me.

At the end of the first day, I visited the Navy Pier with three friends.

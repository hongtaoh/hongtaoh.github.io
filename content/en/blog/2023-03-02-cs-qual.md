Three are three requirements for passing the qual at UW CS:

1. The committee should comprise of at least three faculty members.

2. At least two of committee members should be core CS faculty members (not affiliates). 
  - You can have one faculty member who is not a CS core faculty member (S/he does not even has to be a CS affiliate). 
  - The advisor can be anyone of the three, which means your advisor does not have to be a CS core or affiliate faculty member.

3. You have to declare at least two committee members (which include your advisor) before you start your qualification exam or project.

Other things I learned about:

- The qualification should, ideally, be completed at the end of your 6th semester. 
- The qualification is comprised of two parts: 1) passing the qual exam/projecct; 2) meeting the breadth requirement
- The qual committee do not have to be the same as the committee for your prelim.

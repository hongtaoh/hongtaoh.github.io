  - For both males and females, the cumulative distribution of the number of partners in the previous 12 months almost perfectly followed a straight line, indicating scale-free power-law characteristics;

  - For both genders, the cumulative distribution of the total number sexual partners in the entire lifetime followed a straight line only when $k > 20$. 

  - The network of sexual partners is a scale-free one, meaning that you cannot assume, for example, 90% of the individuals have 3 - 10 partners. This is simply because there is no inherent scale. It's a crazy world, literally. I cannot believe that a fair number of people have over 100, even 1000 partners. Isn't this a crazy world?

Other notes:

  - Thanks to this paper, I now know that for a power-law distribution to show a straight line, I need to use CDF (cumulative distribution function)

  - One thing I didn't understand is that how could the authors conclud that "the rich get richer" by simply looking at Figure 2a? I don't think it a rigorous remark.

### 1. Del Vicario et al. (2016).

This piece is a little bit too technical for me, especially the second part that involve modeling. Also, I had difficulty understanding the conceptualization of "homogeneity" and "polarization".

My main takeaway from this article:

  - Information on social media quickly reach in 2 hours around 20% of the people it can reach in the end, and reach in 5 hours around 40%. This is true for both science and rumors. 

  - Science news is usually quickly diffused. However, long-lasting interest doesn't correspond to the size of the interest. This means, even though people keep sharing it, not a lot of people will be interested in it. 

  - Conspiracy rumors diffused slowly and its cascade size is positively correlated with its lifetime. Meaning that the longer it lasts, the more people become interested in it.

This is the kind of study I admire: short, interesting, and impactful.

- Among 7 million distinct URLs shared by 10 million Facebook users in the US, 13% were hard news;

- Around 20% of a person's friends had the opposite political affiliation;

- Liberals had fewer friends who shared news from the other side;

- Controlling for the position of the news feed, it seemed conservatives were more likely to click on cross-cutting content, i.e., news that came from the other side; This result suprised me.

- Even though scholars use effect size and confidence intervals, the ultimate goal of looking for small *p*s will ruin everything.

The work is indeed significant. It compared the spreading of true and false news on Twitter and concluded that the false spread faster, deeper, and farther than the truth. False political news, in particular, is diffused especially broadly and deeply. 

- Was it because those who spread the false were more influential or active?

Not really. Those who spread false news had fewer followers, followed fewer people on Twitter, are less likely to be verified, and had been on Twitter for less time. 

- Was it because false news was more noval and users are more likely to retweet information with more novelty?

  - False rumors were indeed more novel than the truth;
  - False news was objectively more novel, but did users get it? 
    - Yes, replies to false news showed greater surprise and disgust, whereas the truth inspired more sadness and joy. 

- Was it because of selection bias? I mean, the tweets from the six organizations might not be representative of all tweets. 
  - The authors verified a second sample of Tweets, which were labled by three undergraduates students as true, false, or mixed. Again, the results were the same. 

- Did false news spread faster, deeper, farther, and more broadly because of bot activities? I mean, was it because bot crazily retweeted and replied to false news?
  - Two bot-detection algorithms were applied independently to detect and remove bots before data analysis. Results were the same. This has significant implications: that false news travelled faster and farther not because of bots, but because of humans. 

### I had several issues:
1. Bad data visualization

At first glance, data visualization in this article is good. However, most of the figures used only red and green and therefore are not friendly to color-blinded people.

2. Content analysis

They should report Krippendorff's alpha rather than an agreement of 90%

3. No hypotheses beforehand

- Study goal: Study whether and how social network sites encourage recruitment in social movements.

- Why wasn't it published on *Nature* or *Science*: A first look at this paper made me feel that it should have published on *Nature* or *Science*. I believe the authors must have tried. After reading the whole paper, I concluded that lack of sufficient evidence might have been the reason why it didn't manage to do so. As the authors have mentioned in their limitations part, there were so many factors other than Twitter that influenced the movement in question, and it was impossible to single them out.

p 1-3. Lazeret et al. (2018). The science of fake news. *Science, 359*(6380), 1094-1096.

- Increasing partisan preferences in the US created a context for fake news to attract huge audiences;

- We don't know the exact ratio of fake news against real news, and we don't know the medium-to-long-run effect of exposure to fake news on people's attitudes. 

- Bots on social media are hard to detect. Once a detecting technique is developed, bots will upgrate themselves. 

- Possible interventions:

  1. Encouraging people to use fact checking. However, we are not sure whether this is useful or not, partyly due to people's confirmation bias and desirability bias. 
  2. Internet oligoplies should collaborate with academia to understand how pervasive fake news is. Also, these oligoplies' power should be contained by, for example, legal systems.

Lazer et al. (2020)

- Definition:
  - Compuational social science: language, location, movement, networks, images, and video, using statistical models that capture multifarious dependencies.

- Problems
  1. Interdisplinary research not encouraged enough, especially that involve cooperation between social and computer scientists, due to unfavorable policies at universities;
  2. Proprietary data unavailable to researchers.
  3. Available data is not intended for research and won't be shared with other researchers, which impedes reproducibility.
  4. Lack of regulatory guidance from university IRBs about collectinga nd analyzing sensitive data. 

- Recommendations
  1. Collaborate and negotiate with private companies for data;
  2. Build infrastructures that provide data as well as preserve participants' privacy;
  3. Develop new ethical guidelines;
  4. Reorganize universities so that 1) multi-displinary collaboration is professionally or fanancially rewarded, and 2) enforce ethical research
  5. Researchers make sure that they do public good.

2. Recapping Centola (2010):

- Contribution: An experimental design that ran contrary to previous findings regarding the strength of weak ties. 
- Conclusion: networks with local clustering are conducive to behavioral diffusion. 
- Method: An experiment with two groups. One group found themselves in a random network, and the other group in a clustered-lattice network. **Degree distribution of the two networks are identical**.
- Why could it be published on *Science*: Maybe the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of network topology on behavior spreading.
- My question: I didn't see many long ties in the "small-world network" in Figure 1.
- Improvements: I didn't know all of the statistical tests used in this paper. I know Mann-Whitney U test but I don't know Kolmogorov-Smirnov. I am wondering whether the study could be conducted using Bayesian statistics.

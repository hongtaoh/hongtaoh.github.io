I was inspired by the story of [*This scientist read a paper every day for 899 days. Here’s what she learned*](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/this-scientist-read-research-academic-paper-every-day-what-she-learned), so I decided to try it myself: Dedicating half an hour everyday to reading papers. Let's see for how long I can keep doing it. 
{{<end>}}

{{<block class="reminder">}}

I thought about giving APAD up in September - October of 2022. So I did not read papers regularly from 09/13 to 10/21. I also did not read papers from 05/31 to 06/06, and also on 2022-06-08. I will slowly make them up.

In this paper, the authors used six open-source fairness visualization tools to study how these tools help students understand algorithm biases.

3. Moere, A. V., & Purchase, H. (2011). [On the role of design in information visualization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1473871611415996). Information Visualization, 10(4), 356-371.

This is a very interesting article. The authors argued that information visualizations have "utility", "soundness", and "attractiveness". Academics tend to focus on the former two and overlook "attractiveness". This paper argues that "attractiveness" should be considered as a viable dimension in teaching, evaluating, conducting vis research.

I like this paper. The authors proposed a visualization recommendation system that is based on rules. Specifically, these rules are based on data abstraction and task abstraction. After identifying the data that users have and the tasks users want to perform, the system will recommend appropriate visualizations.

They have the following tasks:

- Distribution
  - Extrema
  - Mean/median/mode
  - range
  - characterize distribution

- Part-to-Whole
  - Categorical filter
  - Categorical analysis

- Change over time
  - Trend
  - Sort

- Comparison
  - Sort
  - Filter
  - Trend

- Relationship
  - Retrieve value
  - Cluster
  - Correlation
  - Anomalies

  - keyword search
  - querying
  - question answering
  - browsing

- Enjoy
  - augmentation
  - vis description generation

- Produce
  - annotation
  - documentation
  - visualization creation

These tasks are about why users interact with visualizations using natural language. Then the authors explored how natural language is used.

2. Heer, J., Bostock, M., & Ogievetsky, V. (2010). A tour through the visualization zoo. Communications of the ACM, 53(6), 59-67.

I really like this paper. The authors analyzed the gender disparities in NAS members. They find that there are significant gender differences in the citation networks among these NAS members. These differences are so strong that we can predict a member's gender based on the citation network. There are no significant structural differences in the citation network based on the prestige of the affiliations that members work in.\

1. [Socially situated artificial intelligence enables learning from human interaction](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2115730119)

This is innovative work. Humans learn from interacting with other humans. Shouldn't AI do the same? The authors proposed the concept of "socially situated artificial intelligence". They let AI interact with humans on social media through AI posting questions about images using human language and human responding (or not responding) as comments. They treated it as an iterative reinforcement learning problem. The field experiment lasted for eight months and reached 236K social media users. The results show that this method is better than the baseline.

1. [Beyond deep learning](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2214148119)

This is a nice piece. The author talks about the trend that AI researchers blend deep learning with classic AI methods.

It introduces "intuitive physics", for example, two objects cannot be at the same place at the same time; things will fall if it is not supported by something. I feel that this is similar to "Common knowledge."

2. [What are the limits of deep learning?](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1821594116)

Deep learning systems may distinguish between sofas and chairs but they won't know that these objects are for people to sit on.

This is a cool project. The authors posited that visualization tasks can be seen as residing in a three dimensional space: Abstraction (from abstract to concrete), Composition (from low-level to high-level), and Perspective (objectives versus actions). The first two are continuous whereas the last one is dichotomous.

Then the authors reviewed task related literature and examined the relationship between them and the model proposed here.

I like this study a lot. The current ranking of visual channels is based on the task of comparing two values. However, this task is not that important in real settings. The authors instead used the task of reproducing a chart right after seeing it. The results show that even if there are only two marks in the chart, the existing ranking does not hold. Also, the ranking changes as there are more marks in the chart.

2. [A causal test of the strength of weak ties](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476)

This study tested the strength of weak ties empirically using 20 million people's data from LinkedIn. They varied the prevalence of weak ties in their recommender system (People You May Know). They tested whether weak ties are related to job mobility. The results supported the weak tie theory but with three major revisions. First, the relationship between the strength of weak ties and job transmission shows an inverted U shape. Second, moderately weak ties and the weakest ties created the most job mobility. Third, the strength of weak ties is dependent on the type of the industry. Weak ties created job mobility in digital industries but not so much in other industries.

I say "almost" because, for example, you only have one friend in common and you are unfamiliar with each other. This is fascinating for me. This somehow shows that the society is not as "cold" as we thought.

This is important work. The results show that collaboration networks can be viewed as a social capital that is distributed in an unequal and gendered way. The study shows that gender differences in productivity and prominence in mid-age researchers can be explained by the collaboration networks. The results also show that collaborating with senior authors is correlated with higher productivity and prominence of the junior authors.

This is a very surprising study for me. It is surprising because I didn't know neural networks were used in social science, or in Communication, as early as in the 1990s!

I really liked the abstract of this paper. In fact, its abstract is the best among all papers I've seen! The aim of this paper is to predict what variables predict television nonviewers and what predict extreme viewers. The data was from the General Social Surveys from three years: 1988, 1989, and 1990. The authors performed prediction using neural networks and also a discriminant analysis. The results show that neural networks outperform discriminant analyses.

The analysis results show that demographics were strong predictors of nonviewers and family related and lifestyle related variables were strong predictors of extreme viewers.

This is an inspiring piece. With current technologies, we are connected with people anywhere and anytime. But the author askes, is this good? It might not be good. It might be an illusion that we are in contact with so many people; only few of them really care about you. You are in fact alone in the world.

The authors also talked about these three points: 1) We embrace new technologies; 2) We get a lot from technologies and might be happy with it (otherwise, why are we still using it); 3) However, research shows that productivity, mindfulness and sleep quality improve when we do not use smartphones anytime and anywhere.

This seems to be a puzzle.

Inspired by this work, I am thinking of studying whether machine learning is doing any good to our lives.

This paper compares two ways of prediction: relying on presumed models, or building models from data. The authors also introduced decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

The authors argue that although machine learning methods are black boxes which are not interpretable, it does not mean that they are inferior to interpretable data models which are less accurate. He believes that the point is not interpretability, but rather getting accurate information, or prediction.

He warns that a large amount of data is being produced daily, and statistics has to use other tools to solve problems people face rather than sticking to only familiar tools such as data modeling.

This is a powerful article. It introduces the ideas by Stuart Russel, a CS professor at UC Berkeley. He worries that if machines are only programmed to maximize a certain goal, then the world will be in trouble. He proposed three "principles of beneficial machines":

1. Machines should be programmed to maximize human preferences.
2. Machines are uncertain about what human preferences are.
3. Machines should learn from human behavior about human preferences.

Russel also believes that the "off-switch" problem is at the core of our control over machines. If we are unable to switch a machine off when it is maximizing its goals, we would be in trouble.

There are also some problems with the three principles above:

1. Humans don't know what their preferences are. Even if they do, their actions do not necessarily align with those preferences.
2. Humans' preferences change.
3. Good people have preferences. Bad people do as well. What if machines learn from bad people?

The authors then provided the viewpoints of Latin American scholars' on open science.

This is a very different paper. It talks about how to solve the problem of racism in chat bots. The story of Microsoft's Tay showed that chatbots can be manipulated. The easy way to protect chatbots from racism is using a blacklist of words. However, this is not the ultimate solution. For example, "Pakistan'' might be included in the blacklist. However, doing so will make lives inconvenient for Pakistanis. This paper talked about how to solve this problem utilizing NLP, machine learning and deep learning technology.

This is a very cool project. The authors build artificial agents to learn human language in a 3D space. I feel this is a future direction as unless AI can relate human language to the real world, we are not able to fully trust the decisions made by AI.

There is a conference called [ACM FAccT (ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency)](https://facctconference.org/). It seems to be really cool.

We can study human behavior, and by the same token, we can study machine behavior. AI agents are ubiquitous, and are impacting our day-to-day lives, for everyone of us. The authors came up with three motivations behind the new field called machine behavior that they are proposing:

  1. AI agents are becoming ubiquitous.
  2. It's hard to predict what outcomes AI agents generate. AI models are becoming increasingly complex. Even if the algorithms are simple, its outcome may still be complicated. Also, many algorithms in use today are proprietary and not available to the public, making it harder for us to know what outcomes these models will generate.
  3. Algorithms are impacting our lives. We need to study their effects on humanity.

What topics or dimensions should we study in the field of machine behavior?
  1. Mechanisms behind the behavior. For this, we need more interpretability.
  2. How the behavior might change. For example, new data is fed, or the model updates itself from interacting with the world (like reinforcement learning).
  3. Functions: what functions do these algorithms fulfill for human creators, for example, companies? These help us understand why some algorithms prevail while others fade away.

This paper talks about intersectionality in CHI proceedings. The authors found around 150 past CHI papers about this topic. The findings of this research are: 1) researchers tend to focus on one aspect of user identity rather than intersectionality; 2) research on race is relatively less than that on gender and class.

This is indeed meaningful and impactful work.

Why is the Stanford QA needed? To train data-intensive models, we need a large amount of high-quality data. However, the existing datasets are either large but low-quality or high-quality but small.

The team collected English articles from Wikipedia and asked crowd workers to read a passage in four minutes and come up with five questions. They can ask hard questions and are encouraged to use their words in the question. The answer for each question must be directly from the article (in fact, the crowd workers are asked to highlight the answer from the article). Each answer does not have to be a single word; it can be a long phrase.

In order to make it more robust, for development and testing dataset, the team asked other crowd workers to select the shortest span that can answer the question. That is to say, for the development and testing dataset, some workers previously have already proposed questions and provided answers. Now, the authors asked other workers to provide possibly shorter answers. This is because in testing, if the machine chooses a shorter span (compared to the first answer) which is actually correctly answering the question, it will also be labeled as correct.

Based on the data, the authors came up with a logistic regression which has a F1 score of 50%. The human performance is 86.8% (F1 score).

This is indeed a very unique paper. The authors argue that today's social science is dominated by Western philosophy. Eastern thoughts, specifically those of Buddhist and Taoism, are largely ignored. The author argues that as the world powers are shifting from Europe and the US to Asia (China, Japan and India), it might be helpful to think about how social science can be done with an Eastern mind.

The main aim of this project is to test whether MTurk is a viable platform to conduct experiments. The authors replicated seminal experiments by Cleveland & McGill (1984) and also conducted other experiments. They found that the results by Turkers are reliable and believe that using MTurk can lower the cost and time required for conducting experiments.

This study in some sense replicated the experiments about bar charts in the classical study by Cleveland and McGill (1984). In the original study by Cleveland and McGill (1984), there are five bar chart types: adjacent bars, separated bars, aligned stacked bars, unaligned stacked bars, and divided bars. Adjacent bars lead to the least errors in bar height comparison tasks and divided bars lead to the highest errors.

However, Cleveland and McGill (1984) did not study why so. In the current study, the authors wanted to examine the mechanisms behind all these. The results generally confirmed the accuracy ranking in Cleveland and McGill (1984). The authors provided explanations of the error sources. For example, they found that separation between bars makes the comparisons difficult.

The authors argue that even for simple charts like bar charts, we still do not understand them fully.

This is a canonical study.

The idea of this paper is this: rather than designing visualizations based on common sense or intuition, we need to design them based on scientific theories. The authors proposed ten *elementary perceptual tasks* as shown in Fig. 1. Some examples: (1) position along a common scale, (2) positions along nonaligned scales, (3) length, direction, angle, (4) area, (5) volume, curvature, and (6) shading, color saturation. The tasks are ordered such that the first leads to the most accurate perception. The authors suggest that when we design charts, it is better to use tasks that lead to more accurate perceptions.

This is a cool study. THe authors studied the visual embellishments of bar charts. They identified six types of embellishments: rounded tops, triangle bars, capped bars, overlapping triangle bars, quadratically increasing area bars, and bars extending below zero. They compared these designs with the baseline bar chart.

To compare the effectiveness, they recruited 100 users from MTurk. These Turkers completed two tasks: identify absolute values of a bar, and estimate the percentage of bar to another one. The results show that these embellishments hinder, rather than help, users understand data presented in the bar charts.

In Twenty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

This paper introduces a new method of providing image captions. It first identifies objects, basically a subject and an object, for example, a person and a motorbike. Then it uses knowledge extracted from web texts to put these two elements together, producing a highly probable caption such as "A person is riding a motorbike".

I agree that this method is innovative but it is not trustworthy at all. We can only get the most likely combination of two objects (if we identify them correctly), but this combination is not necessarily reflective of what is really going on in the video.

This is indeed innovative and influential work. The researchers came up with an interactive tool that generates test examples for NLP models. This method is applicable to most NLP models, either commercial or academic. This model involves (1) capabilities such as Negation, Coreference, Logic, Robustness to typos and other errors, Fairness, etc, and (2) Test types (Minimum Functionality tests, Invariance, and Directional Expectation tests). 

They found that this CheckList is able to identify bugs even in models that have been extensively used and debugged.

This study compares four designs of grouped bar charts for comparison tasks. The four designs are: a simple grouped bar chart; grouped bar chart with juxtaposed differences; single bar chart with juxtaposed differences; difference charts. The results show that bar charts with juxtaposed differences are better for comparison tasks.

When values to present have large gaps, i.e., the biggest one is way larger than the smallest one, it is challenging to present all these values through a bar chart. Two problematic solutions are: 1) breaking the axis; 2) setting an upper bound for the axis. 

<!-- Bar charts variants may include stacked bar charts and du bois wrapped bar charts. -->

This study found that wrapped bar charts enable users to perform better on identification and comparison tasks when the data to visualize is disproportional, but may come with a price: more time spent and higher cognitive load.

The purpose of this paper is this: to modify specific memory in a pre-trained language model so that when prompted, it will give the corrected output. This is important because the predictions by the original pre-trained language model might be outdated. It is computationally expensive to retrain the model. It will be best if we can modify the results without training again. The authors of this paper treat this as a learning problem. They basically built a hyper-network, i.e., a neural network that predicts parameters of another neural network. With this, they can predict the corrected parameter and therefore the corrected output. 

It turns out that this method is very good. Detailed results are shown in Table 1.

Then they came up with a specific design space, as shown in Fig. 4.

- Having common sense is different from knowing more facts. Common sense is the ability to make inferences and decisions based on already known facts. 

- For humans, common sense is not always active. Only when we meet unusual circumstances, do we resort to common sense. If common sense does not help us find the solution, we use deeper thinking instead.

This paper introduces a new dataset called RACE for question answering. This dataset came from English tests for Chinese high school students. This dataset might be challenging for machines because there are many questions that involve reasoning and therefore cannot be easily answered by taking words from the original texts. 

Right now, the highest accuracy achieved by machines is around 70%. It seems very impressive, given that it is the machines that are reading those passages. However, I still am not able to trust this kind of AI. It is still based on statistical learning. I am just wondering: for the next wave of AI revolution, is logical reasoning a necessity or not? Is it enough for us to rely on statistical learning?

This study relies on citation data of over 90 communication journals indexed in web of science. The results show that citations in and out of communication studies focus on only a tiny few other disciplines, such as social psychology, sociology, and political science. Also, although communication tends to cite other fields compared to sociology and political science, it is very weak at receiving citations from other fields. 

Another finding is that the dominance of psychology in communication has been declining. Also, citing interdisciplinary fields outside of the social sciences tend to increase the visibility of communication studies compared to citing other fields.

## 2022-07-15 (Completed on 2022-07-16)

Finished the book of *Rebooting AI: Building artificial intelligence we can trust.* 

### Chapter 1

- The present AI is narrow; it can only do a specific task and not general or broad enough
- Our current approach to AI does not allow it to be true intelligence. 
- People would believe machines understand them even if they somewhat know it's impossible. 

### Chapter 2
- Machine learning solely relying on training data isn't reliable. 

### Chapter 3

This chapter mainly introduces the history of machine learning, specifically the neural networks. 

- Three drawbacks of deep learning
  - Deep learning is greedy. It needs lots of data and relies on data. If the problem changes, deep learning no longer works. 
  - Deep learning is a black box. 
  - Deep learning is unreliable. 

- Deep learning can recognize objects but won't tell you the relations between them. 

- Deep learning is more like an art than science. 

- Reading and Robots are two of the most challenging AI domains. 

### Chapter 4

- Deep learning today is not designed to understand human language. All that is involved is statistics. 

- Computers can't read because they don't know how the world works. 

### Chapter 5: Where's Rosie

- Machine learning can identify objects, but it does not know what all those objects mean and their roles in the real world. 
- Both human language understanding and real robots need cognitive models that can adapt to the changing world. 

### Chapter 6: Insights from the human mind

- Causality is important. 

- Currently, machine learning researchers don't value 'prior knowledge'. Instead, they value learning from a blank stage. This might be a mistake. 

- After reading this passage, I am thinking of building a system where researchers can share their 'models' that have learned (different kinds of) common knowledge. This way, we can build on each other's' work and gradually 'learn' about the real world. 

- To be really intelligent, machines need to have a sense of three things: time, space, and causality. 

- Future AI needs not only big data but also "abstract causal knowledge".

### Chapter 7 Common Sense, and the path to deep understanding

- It is super difficult to endow machines with human-like common sense such as "leaves swing if there is wind."

- To allow machines to master common sense, we need two things: 1) know what kind of common sense is needed; 2) know how to encode/store learned common sense in machines.

- Diagrams are not going to work because there is so much more explicit knowledge not shown there. 

- It is difficult for machines to infer the representation of time from a sentence. 
- Current AI systems don't have a sense of space. For example, it does not know that if you put a pen into a mesh bag, the pen will not stay in the bag. 
- Simulations aren't a good solution to causality reasoning in AI. 

- To change the paradigm, we need a new kind of learning, one that builds upon existing knowledge, rather than starting from scratch every time. 

### Chapter 8 Trust

- We need new metrics to test general intelligence. Turing testing isn't a good option. 

- It will be dangerous for the machines to learn all ethical values from the world, as existing values such as biases based on gender and race, are obviously wrong. 

### Epilogue

>In hindsight, the turning point will be seen not as the 2012 rebirth of deep learning, but as the moment at which a solution to the challenges of common sense and reasoning yields deeper understanding. 

It is hard to predict what the future will be like once general intelligence is achieved. The sky's the limit.

I re-read this paper, trying to get a deeper understanding of it. This time, I know that they first identified around 110 topics, and then clustered them together. Later, they grouped these clusters into subfields. They then examined the subdisciplinary network against four types of networks and concluded that communication as a field is not as fragmented as we previously thought. 

I still have the following questions:

1. How does CTM (correlated topic model) actually work?
2. If CTM tells us the correlation between topics, then how can we know the correlations between subdisciplines?
3. Why should we study the subdisciplinary network, but not the topic cluster network, against the four networks?

Their prompts are better at testing the real capacity of language models. 

Their results show that masked language models are able to do sentiment analysis and natural language inference without finetuning.

This is an editorial piece. I found it very interesting to read. This article summarizes the special issue on open science in Communication. Some of the key points in papers in this special issue:

  - A survey of 1K communication scholars shows that questionable practices are common. 
  - A growing number of communication research papers are mentioning open science terms but little to no effect on how this influences papers' citations. 
  - We need to consider ethical issues in open science. 
  - Open science practices may marginalize scholars in the Global South.

WS1: Corpus
WS2: Internet
WS3: Perception
WS4: Embodiment
WS5: The Social World

The first stage tries to rely on limited text data. The second stage tries to collect a massive quantity of text data and have massive language models. However, these models do not know how those words are related to the real world. The third stage learns about the world through videos and audios. Models based on these perceptions, however, are not able to test hypotheses through actions in the real world. For example, if I ask "what is the feeling of putting my hands on fire?", the model won't be able to answer if there is no relevant data. 

The fourth stage is able to allow models to translate language into actions in the real world. The model will have a mental model of the world and know the properties of objects. 

The ultimate goal of learning a language is to do something for the world. 

The fifth stage is about social interactions. It's impossible to have a dataset large enough to contain all information in the world. Therefore, it's necessary for the (machine) learner to interact with humans and participate in world events. 

The authors mention that most of current NLP research falls into WS2. To move towards WS3, NLP researchers can utilize research in computer vision and speech recognition. In order to test hypotheses through actions (WS4), robotics can help. To socially interact with humans and keep learning (WS5), video games can help.

This paper introduces Transformer, a famous NLP model. Rather than using convolutional or recurrent neural networks, the Transformer uses self-attention in the computation of the representation of its inputs and outputs. I don't totally understand what that means but that's what they say. The transformer model is efficient since it requires less training time. It breaks the record of machine translation.

This article shows that language models pretrained on unlabelled text are able to conduct open-domain question answering without access to any external knowledge base. The accuracy is higher than the benchmark. Also, the accuracy increases as the language model's size grows. Although large language models are computationally intensive, they don't need to (1) search for external knowledge, and (2) parse the external knowledge source and extract answers from it.

This is indeed interesting work! The authors analyzed how gender, culture, English proficiency, country of origin's economy, and the research field of researchers influence the length of their peer-review. The authors find that males, those working in humanities and social sciences, those who are proficient in English, those in developed economies, and those in non-Confucian cultures, tend to write longer reviews.

This is an interesting paper. The authors analyzed top AI researchers' educational backgrounds. Unsurprisingly, they found that most of these researchers were educated in the United States and got their highest degrees from prestigious universities. 

Some of the major findings of this paper:
  - More publications during study is related to higher outputs later. 
  - Those who graduated from prestigious universities have higher citations. 
  - The degrees received, i.e., BS, MS, or PhD have influences on scientific performance for people working in the industry but not for those working in academia.

This study finds that novel papers, characterized by disconnected papers in their references, disrupt science. Conventional papers, characterized by well-connected papers in their references, develop science. It takes longer for novel papers to reveal its impact whereas it takes shorter for conventional papers to get many citations.

With citation being the indicator of a scientist's success, more and more scientists are working on the Incremental Advance stage of scientific ideas, rather than the Exploration and the Breakthrough stages, as is illustrated in Figure 4. This causes scientific stagnation. 

The authors came up with an "edge factor" which measures scientific novelty. Impact factor rewards work done in the breakthrough and incremental stages whereas edge factor rewards exploratory work. 

The authors also mentioned how authors and journals may "play the game" of edge factor. For example, they can use synonyms of an old idea, and then their article will be regarded as containing new ideas. The authors believe that the problem can be solved, by building a comprehensive dictionary or using machine learning algorithms.

This study looks at how emotions and beliefs (about the usefulness of information) are related to sharing information about COVID-19. The authors find that people who have negative emotions and strong belief that the information to be shared is helpful to prevent the disease will share the information with their strong-tie friends. For information sharing with weak-tie friends, only negative emotion is related.

Although I was not able to fully understand this article, I think it is an interesting study. The authors are interested in whether pre-trained language models, both unidirectional (fairseq-fconv, Transformer-XL) and directional (ELMo and BERT) store relational knowledge and how these models compare with knowledge sources (such as Google-RE and T-REx) in terms of allowing us extract that relational knowledge (for example, where was Dant born?). The results show that BERT-large performs very well in terms of enabling knowledge extraction.

In this study, the authors looked at how perceived cancer risks, fatalistic beliefs, and worry about cancer are correlated with cancer information seeking and cancer information avoidance in the US and China.

They found that perceived risks, and cancer worry are correlated with increased cancer information seeking in the US and China. Cancer worry is negatively related to cancer info avoidance in the US but positively related to avoidance in China. This indicates that Chinese survey takers, worried about cancer, actively seek certain information about cancer but at the same time avoid other information.

This is an interesting study. The authors were interested in how trust about source information on COVID-19 is related to information sharing intentions, and how this relationship is mediated by (1) belief about sharing, and (2) emotions. They found that health professionals, government, and academic institutions are more trusted than social media, family, and friends. 

As for mediations, they found that high trust is related to higher intentions of sharing through the belief that sharing leads to positive outcomes. On the other hand, low trust is related to higher intentions of sharing through negative emotions (anxiety, fear, and anger).

This is a thought-provoking article. The authors were interested in whether science is slowing down and why. 

They distinguished between a limited frontier and an endless one. If science is a limited frontier, that means the number of scientific areas and scientific questions we can ask is limited, and the map of science is gradually being filled. If we regard science as an endless frontier, then there are an endless number of possible questions we can answer. If we view science this way, then the slowdown of science can be attributed to the fact that we are focusing on only established fields and not exploring new areas. 

The productivity in the US has been declining since the 1950s, rather than increasing. Since the 1970s, we haven't seen many advances in major technologies, except for computers and the internet.

This is indeed interesting work! The authors were interested in how we can define local news. They then choose two national news outlets, two regional ones, and two local ones. They then analyzed these outlets' followers on Twitter. They especially focused on the location of these followers. They found clear differences in the cumulative percentage of followers by distances (from the outlet) among these outlets, as shown in Figure 1. 

There are, of course, drawbacks of this approach. First, I am not sure why they do not plot hundreds of outlets rather than just six. Second, subscribers to news outlets are not necessarily Twitter users. Third, not all Twitter users share their location information.

This is indeed innovative work. The authors analyzed 17 million job listings on LinkedIn posted between 2005 and 2016. They found that gender biases in the wording of job listings have been declining over the years. They also changed the wording for some listings to remove gender biases and tested whether these changes lead to more applications from applicants who would not apply otherwise. They found that the effects of word changes are limited; smaller than participants' preconceived biases about job types. For example, even if a job related to technology is devoid of gender bias words, female participants may not want to apply.

- Companies that have more diversity have better performance

- We all have biases. To acknowledge it is important because if we do not acknowledge it, we cannot do anything about it. 

- We form a first impression on people we meet. If we have a good impression on them, then it's easy for us to like them. 

- Small changes can make a big difference. 

- Not being part of the problem doesn't mean you are actively part of the solution. 

- Oftentimes we are unaware of the biases we have in our mind. 

### Four types of biases we can change

- Performance bias. Male's performance is often overestimated. Race also plays a role here. White people might get hired or promoted because of their potential but people of color will get hired or promoted based on the work they have achieved and ability demonstrated. 

- Performance attribution. If we see a man who is successful, we might think it is because of his brilliance but if a woman is successful, we might attribute her success to luck and hard work. 

- Competence vs. likeability tradeoff: if a woman is very competent, then we might think she is selfish and not likable but men do not have this tradeoff.      
   - We think that women should do the office housework. To counteract it, we should assign people to do the housework rather than letting people volunteer (because women will be more likely to volunteer).

- Maternal bias: we believe strongly that mothers cannot be good employees.
   - Don't make assumptions that women cannot be good employees when they become mothers. Instead, have direct conversations with them and plan ahead. 

### What we can do to counteract

- For a company, it should set decision-making criteria in the beginning.

This is an interesting study. The authors looked at what factors influenced reposting speed on Twitter. The authors find that reposting on Twitter is highly skewed, with half of the posts examined reposted in half an hour and the maximum gap between first appearance and reposting being over 70k hours. Second, the author found that Twitter users who cared about multiple issues are slower in reposting Tweets.

Philip Guo's newsletter of April 2022, on his 10-year anniversary of PhD dissertation defense. 

   - PhD oral defense is not really a serious thing. The fact that the committee agreed that you can do the defense means they won't fail you. That said, you probably will still be nervous until it is officially over. 

   - To graduate in 5 years, it is better to have 2-3 papers published in legitimate venues with you being the first author and your advisor as the last author. 

   - Do more than simply stapling your N papers to be your PhD dissertation. The reason is that you have been working in your subfield for so many years and you have many insights that were not part of the individual papers that you have published. You can describe the big picture you have in mind in your dissertation. That will be helpful both to you and to scientists of future generations. If you don't write your insights down, you'll most likely forget all of them after you graduate. 

   - Schedule your defense at least two months beforehand. It's so difficult to find a common slot that everyone has time considering that professors are super busy.

[Why doing a PhD is often a waste of time](https://medium.economist.com/why-doing-a-phd-is-often-a-waste-of-time-349206f9addb)

The article argues that doing a PhD is a waste of time. First, there are more PhDs than academia wants. The number of full-time tenure track professor openings is much smaller than the number of newly minted PhDs. Also, PhDs are paid badly. The author argues that PhD students can use their time to do more meaningful things. 

I do not totally agree with the point that PhD is a waste of time. At least for me, as a PhD in Computer Science, I do not think time invested in my study is a waste of time. I see a clear relationship between my expertise and the salary I can make after I graduate. For other majors, there is some truth that time invested in PhD study is not worth it. 

One point I do agree with is that which is hinted at the end of the article: PhD students are good at study and have been the best at what they have done. However, they know little about the "real world". This is very inspiring for me. I kind of understand that even if I feel inferior attending classes (because I am not the best in class), I should not be despised because the people around me are not a representative sample of the whole population. Too often, we PhD students are easily drowned in study and research and we forget about the fact that knowledge is only part of our life; not the whole of it.

This is a highly influential work. 

The author argues that there are four considerations in a comparison task:
  1. identify elements to compare
     - identify targets (what to compare)
     - actions on relationships
  2. know what the challenges are in comparison
  3. decide on the strategies to be used for comparison. 
  4. creat the design for comparison

There are three reasons why comparisons might become difficult: 
  - number of items to compare
  - complexities in each item
  - complexities in the relationships between items

There are three strategies that can be used for a comparison task:
  - scan sequentially
  - subset
  - summarize (two things to consider:)
     - how to create the summary
     - how to present it 

The author mentioned that there are three basic designs for visual comparisons: juxtaposition, superpsotion, and explicit encoding. 

The author also mentioned that summarization can be done in two orders: First find the relationships between objects and summarize these relationships; or first summarize items and compare these summarizations.

What is the relationship between the three basic designs for visual comparisons and the three strategies for a comparison task?

This is an innovative study. The author came up with a taxonomy of data summarization and examined 1) whether this taxonomy covers (randomly selected) visualizations in the visualization field, and 2) how these taxonomies interact.. They think that there are four major methods of data summarization: aggregation, subsampling, filtering, and projection. When choosing from these four methods, a designer can consider these factors: purpose, task, and data. Therefore, there are four factors of summarization in visualization: methods, purpose, tasks, and data types. 

The authors then did a content analysis on randomly selected publications. They wanted to study whether the taxonomy proposed in this paper are well represented by the randomly selected publications, and what are the proportions (for example, how many papers used aggregation method). They also examined how these four factors interact. For example, in visualizations that used the summarization method of aggregation, what are the tasks and data types in these visualizations.

The authors analyzed reporting of the race and ethnicity of participants in CHI publications from 2016 to 2021. They found that reporting race and ethnicity is uncommon in CHI publications (they analyzed 3910 papers but only 340 contained race reporting). I am not sure whether they can claim like this because we do not know the baseline of papers that involve participants. For example, what if only 1/5 of all 3910 papers involve human participants? The rest 4/5 do not need to report race because there are no human participants.

This is important work. The authors argued that supplementary material is being abused by scientists. We needed supplementary material in the past because of the page limit (since we were printing our papers). Nowadays, however, people mostly read papers in electronic rather than printed form. Therefore, it does not make much sense to still use supplementary material. The problems with supplementary material are that 1) they are not fully reviewed, and therefore their quality is not guaranteed; 2) they are not very well integrated into the full text of the paper and therefore are difficult to use; and 3) references in supplementary material are not indexed as citations, making the works referenced un-noticed, which is unfair for scientists whose works were cited in supplementary material.

  1. How about analyzing the citation network (both references and citations)?
  2. How about analyzing the co-author network? Right now, they only studied co-subject networks. But I don't think this is enough. We need to examine the interdisciplinary-ness from the aspect of co-authors' disciplines.

1. This study looks at the past progress made around the globe in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and projects future progress. They looked at whether the globe can reach universal primary, secondary and tertiary education. They also looked at the gender gap. They found that the gender gap in education has been closed in 2018 with some countries in Africa and Middle East having high gender gaps. They also estimate that by 2030, in eighteen countries females will have more education than males. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2198-8

2. This is an interesting study. The authors found that globally, climate has a stronger impact on language diversity than landscape features. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09842-2

3. This is also a very interesting study. The authors used OECD's PISA dataset and found that although females had lower scores than males on math and science (and higher scores on reading tests), they were able to sustain their performance across all three subjects. Therefore, if a math or science test is longer, it will decrease the gender gap in scores. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11691-y

1. This study used data from the world bank which is about learning in countries across the globe. The data shows that learning progress made is only modest. Also, the authors show that learning score is more associated with economic growth than other variables used elsewhere, such as Penn world tables and UN's human development Index.

This papers looks at the results of two feminists interventions aimed to counteract gender divide on Wikepedia. The gender divide on Wikipedia refers to the fact that there is more content about men than women. This study finds that the two interventions were successful at adding content about women but were not successful at reducing structural biases that limit the visibility of that specific content.

This is a very innovative study.

This study looks at what explanations an intelligent system should give to the users. The authors compared two kinds of explanations: 1) why the system makes a specific decision, and 2) why not the system makes a specific decision. The results show that the first kind of explanations leads to better understanding of and higher trust in the system.

This is a very cool study. The authors analyzed 8 million helpline calls during and before COVID-19 collected from 19 countries/regions. They found that calls during the pandemic were mostly driven by (1) fear of being infected, (2) being lonely and (3) physical health. The pandemic did not contribute to more calls about relationships, economic issues, violence or suicide attempts. The authors also found that financial support may help relieve psychological stress people face.

2. If we know more about other people, we feel that they also know about us (even if they don't at all). This means that if we know more about a stranger, we are less likely to lie or to do inappropriate things. I resonate a lot with the finding of this paper. Oftentimes, I tend to know a lot about new friends. Then I assume that they also know a lot about me, which in turn makes me feel that our relationship is closer than it actually is. When I feel we are close, I might invite them to hang out together or even borrow money from them. Sometimes I get rejected. Then I got hurt. Now I know the culprit of my being hurt might be that I know more about them than they know about me. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04452-3

3. This article analyzed and compared 500 editorials published in *Science* and *Nature* from 1966 to 2016. The results show that both journals have an increasing number of editorials on climate change with some peaks (1990; years before and including 2019; and 2015) in response to external events. The two journals also have differences in climate change editorials. Specifically, in the beginning *Nature* focused on government and policy whereas *Science* focused on energy and technology. But in recent years, *Science*, more than *Nature* is focusing on global policy. Journal history, local cultures, and readerships might be the sources of influences that shape how these two journals frame their climate change editorials. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0174-1

This study examines how political alignment impacts racial preference in online dating by studying more than 250K online dating users in the United States. The authors conclude that conservatives, regardless of their own race and sex, prefer same-race partners, compared to liberals. Also, those who do not claim this preference act as if they do. As a result, the gap between conservatives and liberals in terms of preference for same-race partners, while still clear, is smaller.

I skimmed through this paper. The authors used computational methods to study the representation of Reddit communities in terms of Age, Gender, and Partisanship. The analyses were based on over 1.5 billion comments in 10K communities within 14 years of Reddit history. The authors found that Reddit became more "right-wing" after the 2016 US Presidential election; this polarization was more driven by new users. The authors argue that their methods can be applied to the analyses of other online communities as well. 

{{<block class="info">}}
I have a question regarding this paper: How can you assume that all Reddit users are Americans? I personally know a Swedish friend who is using Reddit. If Reddit users are from all over the world, how can you infer the platform's political partisanship?

I skimmed through this paper. 

The authors did a survey among around 2500 people (I guess all of them are German). The authors asked the participants to download a custom app that tracks their smartphone use. The study finds that on average people spend around 2.5 hours using smartphones each day. WhatsApp accounts for 1/5 (0.5 h) of total smartphone usage time. Female participants spend more time on WhatsApp each day than male.

I skimmed through this study. The authors developed a threat dictionary, and validated this dictionary using historical data. The authors found that the threat dictionary is sensitive to wars and conflict, pathogen, and natural disasters. The authors also found that changes in threats are associated with rising conservatism and greater approval of the sitting US presidents.

I really enjoyed reading this piece. It talks about potential problems in human-machine interactions (HMIs). 
    - When building an airport, the developers will consider more the negative impacts (such as noises) on high-income communities as opposed to low-income communities. 
    - Facial recognition works well for East Asian and White populations, but has problems for Black people. 
    - It is problematic to deploy new technologies without letting people in the community know. For example, the use of DigDog by the New York police in New York. 
    - Automatic weapons or robots used as weapons can be problematic.

This report talks about the dilemma facing researchers and medical experts. It is very difficult and unethical to peek into people's brains if it is not because you have to do so for medical reasons. Therefore, when there is an opportunity to do brain surgeries, the doctors will want to do research during the same time. These are opportunities, but, at the same time, bring many ethical concerns. For example, the patients might feel urged to consent even though they are unwilling to participate in research.

Permafrost thaws can lead to disasters, for example, collapses of buildings. Russia has the largest expanse of permafrost in the world, covering 2/3 of the nation. In response to this threat, Russia has started to build a national system to monitor permafrost thaws, which is expected to deliver data in 2023 or later. Some researchers say, however, that the investment in the system is far from enough to generate sufficient data to monitor the thawing.

The authors found that the popularity of open-source software follows a power law such that a tiny number of software received most of the attention (for example, web page visits and downloads). 

The authors also found that open source software development is mostly a single person's performance: the median number of contributors to open source software is 1. 

In the Discussion section, the authors hypothesized that the structure of open source software development is very centralized; that is to say, a key person plays a crucial part.

This paper is too dense for me and I couldn't fully understand it. I got the key idea: treating communities as groups of links is better than as groups of nodes. This is because nodes may belong to different groups, which makes it difficult to infer relationships between overlapping groups from the hierarchy of nodes. Treating communities as groups of links solves this problem.

The authors find that our past and future selves are temporally compressed in a way that our more distant selves are increasingly similar to each other compared to current and nearby selves. Put it in another way, the further our selves are away from our current self, the less discriminable they become. 

The results suggest that representations of our past and future selves might be collectively stored in the same brain regions.

The authors find that 127 professors in the field of biology, chemistry, and physics in the United States, regardless of their own genders, after reviewing the application material to a lab manager position, rated male applicants as more competent, hireable, and worthy of more mentoring. They also gave male applicants higher salaries than female applicants. The application material is the same; the only difference is the gender of the name associated with the application. 

It should be noted that professors responded that they like female applicants more. This may suggest that the biases against women in science is unintentional. Cultural stereotypes might be the reason.

I skimmed through this paper. 

The authors analyzed Tweets activities of over 3,600 accounts of legislators in seven countries (US, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, and UK). The main results are:

  - Twitter's recommender system favors the political right wing in all seven countries except for Germany. 
  - The recommender system does not seem to favor extreme ideologies.

I skimmed through this paper. 

This paper presents the result of a 1-year implementation of Ethics and society review (ESR) at Stanford University. The idea is that IRB discourages considering a research project's long-term impact on human society; they only focus on its impact on human subjects (sometimes animals as well). ESR fills this gap. ESR requires researchers to report their research projects' possible risks for the human society (and mitigation methods) to get the funding. After one year's implementation, the result is that all researchers are willing to continue with it despite the added commitment.

I skimmed through this paper. 

Using data from firms, the authors analyzed the effect of China's emission trading system (ETS) which aims to decrease China's greenhouse gas emissions. The authors conclude that:
    - Carbon price plays a key role. If China can increase its carbon price, more emission reduction can be achieved. 
    - If China wants to achieve its goal of 2030 (greenhouse gas emissions will peak in that year and then decline), it needs to implement a mass-based rule, which exerts an emission cap, rather than a rate-based rule.

The authors compared the accuracy of detecting deepfake videos by humans and by the leading computer vision model. The results show that humans are as accurate as and sometimes more accurate than machines. Humans are better at standard quality videos whereas machines are better at blurry or very dark videos. When the video contains two actors, humans perform better. 

The authors did not find that humans' accuracy improved as they watched more videos. Also, anger decreased humans' accuracy at detecting real videos.

This study looks at the possibility of the public and political elites to respond to emails sent by White names and Black names. This study employs a within subject design; every person receives two emails, one from a White name and the other from a Black name. The results show that both the public and elected officials discriminate against Black senders. 

Among the public, 1.6% responded to the White sender. The figure for Black sender is 1.4%. Among the elected officials, 4.2% responded to the White sender, whereas 3.9% responded to the Black sender. 

Elected officials discriminate against Black people less than the public, but the difference is not statistically significant. 

Fig.2 shows the breakdown of ethnicity of email recipients. It shows that only Black people do not discriminate Black people.

The authors suggest that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) learn from the International Civil Aircraft Organization (ICAO) in terms of avoiding collision with animals. Whale-ship collisions lead to hundreds, and possibly thousands, of whale deaths. ICAO has an extensive database of aircraft-bird collisions (detailed reports for 150,000 incidents). The authors suggest that IMO do the same. The authors also proposed several other measures, which are listed at the end of the article.

I skimmed through this paper. 

The authors used math models and simulations to study whether proposal-based (ex ante) peer review and outcome-based (ex post) peer review lead to different questions that scientists decide to study. The authors find that ex ante peer review makes scientists less likely to pursue risky questions whereas ex post peer review encourages risky questions. 

To promote open science, there is a movement in the scientific community to let researchers submit proposals to journals before they start their study. Journals decide whether to accept it based on the proposals, not the results. This practice encourages open science and deters p-hacking. On the other hand, as this paper argues, it might also make researchers less likely to pursue risky projects.

Menstrual irregularity makes detection of pregnancy harder. Using data from a commercial app where people can record menstrual cycles, the authors of this paper find that those people have higher risks for irregular menstrual cycles: 
   - Those who report polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diabetes, obesity, etc
   - Hispanic women

In some states, laws disallow abortion after the dection of fetel "hearbeat", which usually occurs 6 weeks after the last menstruation. To be eligible for abortion, people need to detect pregnancy early one. However, the earliest symptoms of pregnancy--irregular menstruation--is missed, especially for those who have irregular menstrual cycles.

The authors matched people based on non-political similarities. A matched group might have similar or different political stances. In each matched group, one person read a short and argumentative essay about wealth redistribution in the US. The authors want to see how similarity in non-political interests (high, and low), political stances (high similarity, and low similarity), and the interactions between the two variables, influenced opinion updates. I feel the study is very complicated. 

Major findings:

   - The increase caused by reading an essay by a matched person in favor of redistribution is higher than the decrease caused by reading an essay by a matched person against redistribution. 

   - Polarization for participants with mild views decreased regardless of their matched person's political stance whereas participants holding strong views became more extreme if they were in the "same stance" group. 

   - Feelings of closeness are associated with greater belief updates. This effect of closeness is smaller for those with extreme opinions. 

   - Interaction with people with different opinions decreased closeness; Interaction with people with similar opinions increased closeness. The decrease is greater than the increase.

The results show that (1) after Google moved its server from Mainland China to Hong Kong, its results are as inaccessible, if not more, as those of Baidu, partly due to the Great Firewall and bad links; (2) The results of Google and Baidu are very different, with a very low overlapping rate and different rankings; (3) Baidu's results are biased towards its own services (i.e., against its competitors like Hudong Baike).

The authors presented moving pictures, i.e., a short film to three groups of female undergraduate students. The film consists of movements of three objects: a large triangle, a small triangle, and a small circle. There is also a rectangle that can be opened and closed. This rectangle does not move. 

The first group of students simply watched this film and were asked to describe it. The second group watched it and were asked to interpret movements as those of persons. The third group had the same instructions as the second one; the only difference is that they watched the film in reverse. 

The results show that no matter whether participants were told to interpret the movements as those of persons', they almost all tended to do so. The authors argue that as soon as we consider moving objects as persons, "perception of motive or need is involved."

This is very interesting and meaningful work! The authors first gathered and summarized major guidelines for alternative text (alt text). The authors pointed out that these guidelines do not provide empirical evidence of their rationale.

The authors then went on collecting visualizations from news websites and surprisingly found that none of them include alt texts. Then they turned to scientific visualizations on publications of IEEE Vis, ACM ASSETS, and ACM CHI. 

In the second phase of the study, the authors interviewed 21 blind people and 1 person with low vision. Each participant saw four visualizations without alt texts and was asked to describe what they found. Later, they were given the alt texts.

Based on the interview, the authors found that blind people tend to visualize in their head when they interact with visualizations. Therefore, providing necessary information, such as chart type, color, axes, etc, can relieve their cognitive burden when constructing a mental image of the visualization. 

The authors then provided guidelines for alt text generation based on their interview results.

Remote sensing has also been used to monitor animals, for example, birds and penguins. 

When combined with ground measurements, remote sensing can be more powerful and accurate. For example, a team from Yale University is building computer models based on both remote sensing data and ground measurements, for example, climate and vegetation. These models can be used to predict the location where a given animal species can be found.

I skimmed through this paper. 

Using mobility data (from SafeGraph) of 90 million people in the USA, the authors predicted infection cases with a simple susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model. The model was able to predict the evolution of daily confirmed cases in ten large cities of the USA from early March to early May, despite the changing policies and changing human behavior during this period. 

The model confirmed that people from disadvantaged groups in terms of racial and income are more vulnerable to COVID infections. This is because they visited denser locations and stayed longer. This finding has important implications for public policies. As cities are thinking of reopening, governments can implement policies helping reduce infection rates in low-income areas.

To decide whether to read a paper in detail, among the 46 respondents, (1) publication venue prestige, and (2) publication year, i.e., whether it's recent or not, are the most important factors. 

The authors argued that we should abandon the idea that the prestige of a publication venue dictates the value of the paper.

I skimmed through this paper. 

This paper employed co-word analysis to analyze keywords in IEEE Vis papers from 1990 to 2015. In terms of IEEE Vis, there are two types of keywords: those appeared in actual papers in PDF, and those appeared on IEEE Xplore website. The difference is that authors are free to decide their own keywords and put them in their papers, but when they submit their paper on IEEE Vis platform, they have to choose from keywords already defined by IEEE Vis. The second type is called PCS keywords. Based on these two types of keywords, the authors manually created **topics**. 

This paper is mainly about two questions: (1) what are the key themes among IEEE Vis papers and what are the relationships among them; (2) how do certain keywords emerge and evolve. 

Later, the authors analyzed "topic-coded keywords" and PCS keywords from two perspectives: cluster (how they cluster), and networks (how they relate to each other). The results indicated that topic keywords lack mainstream topics but PCS keywords have mainstream topics. 

The authors also mentioned that keywords inputted by paper authors have unnecessary duplicates, for example, singular vs. plural. This is not helpful. The authors also mentioned a fixed list of keywords. But this list is always evolving and it's a good question to ask whether we can automate the updating process. 

keyvis.org is one of the outputs of this paper where people can search keywords appearing in IEEE Vis papers.

I skimmed through this paper. 

This study analyzed 6 million Twitter users. The authors distinguished between three different types of influencers in Twitter: indegree, retweet, and mentions. The authors showed that:

  1. Indegree influence does not necessarily translate into retweets and mention influences. 
  2. Most influential people have considerable influences over various topics. 
  3. People gain influence through concerted efforts, for example, creating content on one single topic, rather than through accidents.

This study finds that although videos, compared to texts (annotated transcripts of the videos), are more likely to make people believe something actually existed or occurred, they are not more persuasive nor more engaging, at least not in a political context. 

This research contains two studies, both employing a within-subject design. Study one contains 48 persuasive messages covering a wide range of topics and Study two has 24 messages about COVID-19. 

The authors stated that belief is not equal to persuasion. They said that scholars outside of political science should also pay attention to this point. 

{{<block class="info">}}
1. I am not sure whether a participant only saw one message or all the messages. 
2. I am not sure why the authors decided to employ a within-subject design. It seems to me that having watched the video clip will definitely affect the outcome of reading transcriptions.

This paper analyzed all the authors in IEEE Visualization (a conference in the field of Visualization) from a perspective of gender. They examined the overall gender representation, career age, dropout rate, author positioning, collaboration networks, and paper awards. 

The key findings can be found at the end of this paper. Here are two findings I especially noted:

1. On average, it takes more years for an author to publish their first paper at IEEE Vis. 
2. There is a gender bias in author collaboration in IEEE Vis.

This study combined results from surveys and experiments to demonstrate the (1) existence and the (2) effect of gender stereotypes regarding computer science and engineering abilities among children and adolescents. 

Results from the two surveys show that children as young as six and adolescents endorse the stereotype that boys are better at computer science and engineering than girls. The results also show that for individual girls, the more she endorses this stereotype, the less interested she is and the lower sense of belonging she has in the fields.

The experiments showed that girls are less interested in an activity labeled with this kind of gender stereotype compared with an activity without such a label.

The study re-examined the results of two landmark studies. [The first one](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aap9559) studies the diffusion of fact-checked false and true news on Twitter. [The second](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2158) compares the diffusion of news, videos, images, and petitions on Twitter. 

The authors of this paper show that when we control for the cascade size (i.e., the number of retweets), the structural and temporal differences in the first study disappear, whereas these differences in the second study remain. This indicates that when the items in diffusion are of the same type, controlling for cascade sizes explains their structural and temporal differences in diffusion. When they are of different types, controlling for cascade sizes does not explain their structural differences in diffusion patterns.

- The rule of "consulting indigenous communities" which mostly applies to USa may not work for other countries, for example, those in Central and South America. 

- Using ancient DNA research to establish group identity can be potentially extremely harmful.

- Five guidelines
  1. Follow regulations in the places where they work and where they obtain human remains. When local regulations are insufficient, researchers should follow guidelines below. 
  2. Have a detailed plan before doing any study: research questions, DNA data to be used, techniques to be employed, where to store data, etc. 
    - responsibility is not transferable. 
  3. Minimize damages to human remains. 
  4. Make data public after publication. 
  5. Respect and be sensitive to other stakeholders' perspectives. 
    - Genetic data may be inconsistent with other forms of knowledge. When this occurs, researchers should never decrease the importance of traditional knowledge and long-held beliefs.

### Problems

- Insufficient quality of measurements
  - Measurement models: tie theoretical constructs to observable data
  - In social sciences, the constructs we are measuring, predicting, and explaining are unstable and they are influenced by the mere act of measuring, predicting, or explaining. 

- The consequence of mis-measurements
  - There might be a mismatch between the theoretical understanding of a construct and the measurement: what we measure is not what we want to measure
  - How to anticipate the side effects of measurements in this "algorithmically-infused society"?

- The limits of existing social theories

  - We need theories explaining the role of algorithms in societies. 
  - In social sciences, should research be theory-driven or data-driven? This is a question. 

### Solutions

- Possible solutions to above three problems: (1) develop **responsible** and **trustworthy** models for measurement; (2) mitigate negative effects of mismeasurements; and (3) develop "empirically informed theories". 

- How to improve measurements
  1. Use different from different sources (e.g., self-report, mobile phone apps, experimental data, etc)
  2. Have good guidelines. For example, to document, develop, and maintain measurement models. 
    - Measurement itself may affect the outcome. For example, ranking of popularity influences popularity itself. 

- Responsible social science agenda
  - Are the measurements "just and equitable", "transparent and interpretable", and "privacy preserving"?

- To integrate data and measurements in theory-building might be beneficial. This is more so at algorithmically infused societies where new phenomena emerge frequently which requires theories to be updated. 

- We need to avoid "black box measurement models" which rely on unjustifiable assumptions, inaccurate logic and biased data. 

- We need to consider the potential consequences of measurements. These consequences might affect individuals and societies, and might also be hard to identify and quantify.

I like this piece. I believe some of the concerns brought up in it will be real. 

- Privacy. Neural data is so personal. Imagine a hacker hijacking the BCI system you are using, "stealing" all of the thoughts and emotions you had since your childhood. He will know more about you than anybody in the world. I agree with the suggestion that access and sale of personal neural data be strictly regulated, much like sale of human organs. 

- Identity. This is a very pressing concern. Imagine your brain is connected with many others. You don't even know which thought is yours. Then it's natural you lose your sense of identity. This can be spiritually enlightening or psychologically devastating, depending on your reaction. 

- Augmentation. It's so easy to have an "augmentation arm race": people, or even countries, augment their abilities through nanotechnologies. This will exacerbate social inequality.

The authors study the characteristics of Twitter users susceptible to social bots based on the data from Social Bot Challenge 2011.

The study is also very limited. For example, all the users had an interest in or had retweeted about *cats*. In addition, the dataset is too small: only around 400 users (76 susceptible and 298 non-susceptible). But I like this paper: it is short and clear.

- Reference price is important. We will consider a beer from a resort hotel worth more money than that from a grocery store. Sellers make use of this by telling consumers how much money they are saving relative to the regular price. 

- If people have two stocks, one of which is increasing in value and the other one decreasing, they tend to sell the winner rather than the loser. This is not rational. 

- Paying with credit cards means payment is (1) later than, and (2) separated from the purchase. This makes the payment less salient. Another thing making a payment less salient is that multiple bills arrive together.

Google and its thousands of developers around the world have been using one single monolithic repository which contains one billion files and 35 million commits. Google used tools like Piper and CitC (Clinetns in the Cloud) to support using one monolithic repository. 

Using a monolithic repository has benefits such as encouraging collaboration and easier dependency management. The drawbacks are that it requires investment to support such a huge repository and the codebase might become too complicated. However, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and that's why Google is not interested in splitting the repository.

Abhraneel's study tries to compare insights (operationalized as *recall* and *comprehension*) users obtain from visualizations with narratives and with interactivity (there are four conditions, see Fig. 1 on p.9).

- The study finds that 73% of participants in CHI publications from 2016 to 2020 are from "WEIRD" (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries where 97% come from countries that satisfy all the five "WEIRD" variables. 

- Of 2,7688 papers, 2,611 had human participants. Of these 2,611, only 38.9% reported country origin of participants or allowed guessing based on the authors' country origin. 

- Around 70% of all the participants are university students or have a university degree.

- Over 80% of authors recruit participants "in their own backyards."

The study uses three data sets, i.e., NIH grants applications, startups, and terrorist attacks to test a simple one-parameter model that predicts failure & success. The model works pretty well. Key findings:

  - Success is not due to chance. 
  - People who succeed do not necessarily try more times than their failed counterparts. 
  - Among successful people, there is significant improvement in the second attempt compared to the first one. This improvement is absent for the failed group. 
  - It is unnecessary to learn from all past failures.

I skimmed through the whole book. Some suggestions I bore in mind:

  - Don't let graduate school kill your personal time. You need an adequate amount of sleep. You need to eat and drink well. You need to have a personal life. 
  - Especially in the first year, if you want to collaborate with two different professors, make sure to let them know. Otherwise, one of them will be surprised if you decline the opportunity to work with him/her. (p73)
  - Set aside time each day, at least each week, for writing. Do it even though you don't feel like doing it that day/week. 
  - Write one co-authored paper and one solo-authored paper each year in the first two years of your PhD. 
  - Mentorship is better than apprenticeship. The first means you work with more than one advisor to develop your own research agenda whereas the second means you work for only one advisor on his/her research project. 
  - Practice your research talk! You definitely need practice. 
  - *R* is good!

{{<block class="info" >}}
I disagree with Tom's suggestions about websites (p.70). Tom says it is not very useful if you have a professional website at the start of your PhD as you don't have much stuff to put on it. Rather, he suggests a website at the end of PhD when you are looking for a job. 

I highly disagree with it. In my opinion, **a homepage is much more than your CV**. Yes, you might not have papers to put on your homepage, but there are millions of other things you can put. Write blogs! Document your daily tangible progress! Publish your projects! Introduce yourself! These activities will (1) let you know what you lack, and (2) motivate you to make progress each and every day.

Again, your homepage is more than your CV!

The authors initiated a few neutral bots on Twitter, called "drifters". These drifters are the same except for the political alignment of the initial account they follow. The key findings of this paper:
  
  1. The information drifters receive is largely dependent on the initial accounts they follow. 
  2. Most drifters find themselves in echo chambers. Echo chambers of conservative accounts are especially dense. 
  3. Right-leaning drifters encounter more low-credibility information. 
  4. The type of content a drifter receives is not manipulated by the platform, i.e., Twitter. Rather, it was largely dependent on the political alignment of their friends.

This paper analyzed attention cycles for deceased public figures based on data collected from (1) news on the web and (2) Twitter mentions. The authors find that short-term boosts last for around 30 days within the death. On average, long-term attention boosts are largest for artists and smallest for leaders.

  - Don't expect your PhD thesis to be perfect. If you do, you'll never be able to graduate. 

2. Stearns, S. [Modest Advice](https://stearnslab.yale.edu/modest-advice)

  - Prepare for the worst: your research might fail, you won't get along with your advisor. 
  - Your advisor doesn't have time to care about you. You have to figure out what to do on your own. 
  - If you don't understand someone else's work, then it's their fault. 
  - You have to figure out on your own why your work is important.
  - Never expect your thesis to be perfect. There is no perfect thesis. 
  - Be open to job opportunities outside of your PhD. This prevents you from losing your independence. If you know you have other options outside of your research, you are better off. 
  - Avoid taking lectures. 
     - "To learn to think, you need two things: large blocks of time, and as much one-on-one interaction as you can get with someone who thinks more clearly than you do."
  - "Write a proposal and get it criticized."
  - At least once a year, send to your advisor a 1-2 page file documenting the progress you've made to your program. Your advisor will appreciate that. 
  - Start publishing papers early on. 
  - Publish regularly but not too often. Uncited papers are a waste of time and energy.

The authors examined the relationship between (1) the degree of interdisciplinarity of research proposals and (2) the success rate of this proposal being approved of. 

The dataset consists of all proposals, both successful and unsuccessful, submitted to the Australian Research Council Discovery Programme from 2010 to 2014. 

Success rate is easy to calculate but "interdisciplinarity" of a proposal is not. Researchers used to measure "interdisciplinarity" by checking specific words like "interdisciplinary" or through bibliometric analysis. These two measures have many disadvantages. The authors here propose a new measure called interdisciplinary distance (IDD).

The results show that interdisciplinary proposals have lower success rates and this is not because universities with higher success rates submit more narrowly focused research proposals.

👍 Ruder S. (2020). [*10 Tips for Research and a PhD*](https://ruder.io/10-tips-for-research-and-a-phd/)

1. Read broadly. 

  - Look beyond your immediate interest. Papers that connect different topics and even different fields are insightful. 
  - It's better to read 10 papers superficially than to read one paper in depth. With a paper management system, you can always go back and read more deeply. 

2. Work on two things. 
   - If you only have one project in hand, then : 1) when the project fails, you lose motivation; 2) when the project comes to a standstill, you have no choice but to keep grinding. In comparison, if you have two projects, you can work on the other one if one project is stagnant, which gives you a rest and maybe a new perspective. 

   - If the two projects are in different fields, then it's better to focus on one project a day. 

3. Be ambitious. 

   When you have two projects going on, one can be a safe one and you can take risks with the other one. The risky one might have more impact if it succeeds. Work on something that excites you. Challenge the status quo. 

4. Collaborate. 

   - If you collaborate with others remotely, it's important to "communicate clearly and to set expectations". 

   - Be open in terms of collaboration. Work with something different than your supervisor. Collaborate with people from a different university than your own. 

5. Be proactive. 

   Seek out collaborations, meetings, and advice actively. Talk with people.

6. Write a blog. 

   Writing a blog helps you develop your communication skills.

7. Keep a source of positive energy. 

   - Work on things that excite you. If you cannot decide things to work on, try to find an angle that excites you. 

   - Establish a support network that you can count on. Surround yourself with positive people. 

   - Find something that you can fall back on when things don't go well: exercise, a side project, meditation, blogging, to name just a few. Always remember that your well-being is the single most important thing. 

8. Play to your strengths. 

   This section is very inspiring for me personally. I come from a non-CS background and should use this as a strength. A different perspective on and/or approach towards problems is my strength. 

9. Intern or visit a university. 

   - If you are deciding between the industry and academia, an internship or a research visit can give you insights. 

   - Working with a mentor different from your advisor can help you grow. 

10. Play the long game. 

   Be nice 😎.

This paper is significant because it reconciles two opposing models of individuals' career productivity. The first model is the "Matthew effect" which believes that there is a unique period when a person performs consistently better than in other periods. The second model argues that the best work is purely random and is driven by high productivity. 

The hot-streak model proposed by this paper argues that peak-performance period occurs randomly in a person's career, but high-impact work is more likely to occur during this hot-streak period. 

The study begins by investigating the probability of each of the three most impactful work (`$N*$`, `$N**$`, and `$N***$`) by an artist, film director, and a scientist and finds that each of the three works by an individual occurs randomly. But when the authors looked at the distance between individuals' most impactful work, they found that high-impact work tends to occur together. That is to say, there is a temporal correlation between highly impactful work for an individual. 

Some other key findings in this paper:

1. All three careers, i.e., artists, directors, and scientists have peak-performance periods, but the hot-streak pattern varies across careers. See Figure 2 for details. 

2. Hot streaks rarely happen more than once. 

3. For the three careers considered in this paper, a hot streak usually lasts 3-6 years.

4. People are not more productive during a hot streak period.

- Social scientists focus on explanations that are often for causal relationships derived from theories. Computer scientists, on the other hand, emphasize predictions. As long as a model improves predictions, computer scientists is Okay with the model being super complex. 

 - What NHST, a method applied widely in social science research, does is that it tests whether the hypothesized effect derived from theories is not zero. If it is not zero, then researchers conclude these observations are not in conflict with the theory, so the theory can continue to be used as an explanatory tool. 

 However, NHST has the following flaws:

   - NHST does not test directly the outcome of interest, nor the magnitude of effect. It only looks at whether the hypothesized effect based on a theory is non-zero. 

   - In reality, many effects are non-zero. Therefore, statements that a theory cannot be ruled out by data are not valid as they appear. 

- Computer scientists use models to predict. It should be noted that the value of a model does not only depend on its absolute performance, but also its comparison with a baseline. For example, search data is highly correlated with flu numbers two weeks later, which is quite impressive. But it turns out that the same correlation can be found between CDC case numbers in previous weeks, and case numbers in future weeks.

This paper analyzed audiences' log data from three interactive visualizations authored by Idyll, a markup language to create interactive content. 

- My main takeaways from this papers are:

  - People usually spend around 1-2 minutes on a visualization. 

  - If some contents are hidden behind a click, around half of the people will not click and see it. Maybe they don't notice it or they are satisfied with high level information enough to skip details. 

  - Many people will quickly skim through all the content before they dive into details (if they ever do so).

- How I can further this work:

  1. The function of accessing users' log data is restricted to visualizations made by the Idyll language. However, most interactive visualizations available online might be created by other languages. This means we cannot use this feature to study interactive visualizations in the wild. 

  2. I am thinking of a study where I ask participants to interact with many interactive visualizations and look at what features of visualizations (1) make people spend more time and (2) lead to better recall.

I skimmed through this paper. The authors use machine learning theories to model how people form beliefs. This approach is different from the Bayesian one. A Bayesian model of human learning posits that people have a prior and update this distribution based on new data. An ML approach, on the other hand, allows people to discard one prior for another when the old one fails to explain the data.

Instrumental rationale of diversity: diversity brings educational benefits. 

Moral rationale: diversity involves intrinsic values such as justice. 

White participants (students & caregivers) prefer and expect more positive outcomes at instrumentally motivated universities compared to moral motivated ones. Black participants prefer and expect the opposite. University admission officers are aware of, and share these preference and expectation differences.

Both texts from the official websites of universities and admission officers show that universities use instrumental rationales to a greater extent than moral ones. 

Regression models show that when texts from official websites show low morality, high instrumentality correlates with worse graduation rates for Black students. 

The results of this study show that the common practice of diversity among universities favor White Americans rather than racial minorities.

They find that when people are experiencing stress, their blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) will be significantly higher than their baseline level. Resources people have to cope with stresses, such as financial, and interpersonal networks, have a role here as well. The more resources people have, the lower their blood pressure will be when experiencing stress.

The authors find that providing additional training on algebra for incoming 9th graders with median skills in algebra, most of whom were minorities from low-income families, increased their life chances. For example, those who received double-dose on algebra stayed longer in college and were more likely to obtain college degrees. 

The key to the success of this intervention is that (1) the schools strictly adhere to the policy, and (2) schools assign median-skills students to classes with similar or higher, but not lower, math skills.

But when you look at the world from above, you will realize that the reason why you can be successful and earn so much money is not because you are hardworking (there are millions of people who are more hardworking than you are but failed); It's because many others have helped you in one way or another and you are simply lucky.

The authors analyzed 14 million books (Google Books) in English (US), German, and Spanish in 125 years (1855-2019) based on the prevalence of labeled cognitive distortion schemata (CDS) language patterns. As Fig. 2 shows, the prevalence of CDS language markers is much higher nowadays than 100 years ago. The increase starting from 2007/2008 is very obvious. 

I am wondering whether the results are due to artifacts. In the past, the elite few were the sources of the authors. Nowadays, it's becoming more common for ordinary people to publish. Therefore, books in the past were not good indicators of the general public. That said, this is a very impressive study. Since the data is freely available online for everyone, I can no longer use "lack of data" as an excuse for not being able to publish high quality research.

  1. Exact *p*-values reporting has been increasing modestly.
  2. Reporting confidence intervals has been increasing from 6% in 2010 to 15% in 2018. 
  3. Reporting exclusively *p*-value inequalities (such as *p* < 0.01) has been decreasing modestly.
  4. Reporting exact *p*-values does not reduce dichotomous inference.

The analysis is based on data extracted from historical records of ancient Korea.

- Countries experiencing extreme weather events are more likely to suffer from, rather than initiating, military attacks. This means that attacks during extreme weather events are more likely to be *opportunistic* rather than *desperate*. 

- Food shortage mediates the relationship between extreme weather and being invaded. That is to say, extreme weather events have a significant effect on food insecurity which predicts invasion of a country. 

- The possibility of successfully deterring an attack drops when the country being invaded is experiencing extreme weather events. The extent of this drop varies from country to country, though.

- In the world we live now, people focus on results. Social media exacerbates the problem because people only share with others their results and highlights in life. 

- A ture long-term thinking does not involve goals. Goals are about winning an instance of a game whereas systems are about "continuing to play the game."

- You should view a habit you want to develop as a lifestyle (since you'll have to do it forever) rather than a finish line to cross. 

- For habits you wish to get better at, you need a process of reflection and review. Document your efforts and the results. 

- To break a bad habit, you can either decrease your exposure to it or increase the difficulty to access it. 

- In terms of a habit, even if you cannot do the whole thing, you should make a slight improvement. Throw away the 'all-or-nothing' mentality. If you act upon a habit until you feel it can transform your life altogether, you'll end up achieving nothing. 

- **Find out the key moments in your day that determine how you spend the next one or two hours. Work backwards from those moments and try to figure out what was the trigger events that caused these moments.**

3. Observers only see increases for participants who want to increase a trait, but do not see decreases for those who want to decrease a trait. Further analysis shows that observers only see a significant increase in conscientiousness.

4. When traits are measured by self-reports, they do not change 3 months after the end of the intervention among participants who want an increase on a trait whereas they witness another decrease among participants who want a decrease on a trait. Further analysis shows that participants who want a decrease in neuroticism showed another significant decrease after the end of the intervention whereas participants who want a decrease in openness showed a significant increase in openness. 

   When traits are gauged by observers, they increase 3 months after the end of the intervention among participants who want an increase on a trait. Traits are maintained for participants who want a decrease. Further analysis shows that only participants who want an increase in openness show a significant increase in openness after the end of the intervention. All other participants do not show significant changes. 

### Discussions

People in the control group also have motives to change their personality traits. They do not show significant changes because they do not receive treatment. This means that only having motives to change personalities do not necessarily lead to changes.

>The fascinating thing about email is: it takes up little of our time —— we maybe spend an hour or two on email a day —— but it takes up a disproportionate amount of our attention. 

>We can't seamlessly switch from doing one thing to doing another thing. Our mind isn't capable of that. 

>Notice what you pay attention to when you're low on energy. So when you're kind of burnt out a little bit, what apps do you fire up? What websites do you visit mindlessly, out of habit, that just stimulate you and prevent you from really resting? [Knowing those is] a way by which we can shut off autopilot. 

>When we say we don't have time for something, we're really just saying that something's not important to us. You hear people say, "I don't have time to read this book." But then they have time to check email, or read the news, or go on social media for a few hours. What we really mean when we say we don't have time for something is that we don't have the attention or patience for it. You have time for everything. It's just that you choose to do other things. 

>We are not able to focus and reflect at the same time. If you want to unearth more ideas and if you want more rest, I think you need to leave some space between the things you do.

BUt now, there's so much pressure in modern society to perform and to be productive, to be efficient, that we don't have this time to recharge. We tend to pathologize these kinds of sadness or losses of energy. 

>Well, now we've actually had these therapies for 100 years and the world is just getting worse. How could that be? The answer is that all the sensitive, intelligent, resourceful people that should be out changing the world, they're actually just sitting in the therapy room trying to realize themselves or improving themselves. 

>[But] staying with the image of the airplane, I would say the problem is nowadays that the plane is coming down, the pressure in the air cabin is falling, and the masks are coming down. People are putting on the masks, helping themselves, and breathing frantically into these masks. Then we call it mindfulness or therapy or self-help or whatever. And no one really gets up from the chair and tries to see what is going on with this aircraft. The pilots have passed out and the plane will actually crash because no one takes an interest in the whole structure. They only sit in their seat and breathe into their own masks. We actually need people who are brave enough to stop breathing into the mask and take an interest in the overarching structure.

That's a really powerful metaphor!

Mean years of schooling (MYS) alone is not sufficient to indicate a person's true skills. The authors proposed a way to measure the quality of human capital. The authors employed the literacy skills dataset for countries across the globe to compute SLAMYS: skills in literacy adjusted mean years of schooling. Figure 3 shows that even though MYS indicates that the gap between the high-performing and low-performing countries is narrowing, the SLAMYS scores show that this gap is increasing fast. According to SLAMYS scores, the gap between countries above 3rd quartile and below 1st quartile is equivalent to ten years of schooling.

During the pandemic, DataCamp saw a 38% increase in the number of new users, and a 6% increase in exercise time by existing users. 

Figure 2A shows that a slightly higher proportion of new registration comes from high-income and high-college neighborhoods. Figure 2B shows that people in low-income and low-college communities experience a larger increase in their time spent on DataCamp. 

This study indicates that when people have more free time, they can use that time for upskilling, and this change is relatively consistent across regions with varying income, racial and educational compositions. This means that to alleviate the skill gaps in the US workforce, it's a good idea to give employees more free time so that people can upskill.

Finished [Seraj et al. (2021)](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/7/e2017154118)

The authors analyzed posts in r/BreakUps subreddit, and found that a month before, during, and three months after the breakup, people's analytical thinking drops (meaning their thoughts are less structured and logical) whereas cognitive processing increases (meaning that they are trying to understand the situation). Sample markers of cognitive processing (a.k.a, working through) include "because", "understand", "should'', etc. Also evident is that people are using more I-words and We-words. 

The authors did not stop here and asked additional two questions: 1. Does writing a lot about the breakup help people recover? 2. How to compare these changes with language changes among people going through other kinds of emotional upheavals?

Most people (84%) spend 1-4 days talking about their breakups, whereas 16% of people spend 5 or more days. Both the short-term and long-term users have similar language patterns (analytical thinking, cognitive processing, I-words, and We-words) during the months leading up to the breakup. However, it takes long-term users twice as much time as short-term users to return to the baseline value of their language patterns. However, it's impossible to establish a causal relationship. It might be that those who spend more time writing about their breakups experience a more difficult time and thus find it hard to adjust. 

The changes in language patterns among people who experience divorce in r/Divorce mimic those of r/BreakUps users. But r/offmychest users have somewhat different patterns since they post various kinds of emotional upheavals.

In this Viewpoint, Cal Newport argues that it's better to see the impact of technologies from a determinist viewpoint, that new technologies drive human behaviors into unplanned directions. He takes emails invented by IBM and the "Like" button by a Facebook engineer as examples. Emails were meant to facilitate internal communication within IBM. However, people began sending much more messages the moment they started emailing. The "Like" button, designed to replace some approving comments such as "nice!" and "great!", made people check their Facebook account constantly for rewards. 

The author later coins the term *complex side effects*, negative impacts that new technologies may have that are not expected when the technologies were invented. Cal Newport argues that engineers should include the evaluation of complex side effects in their "iterative engineering process".

1. When you have an idea, start writing the paper now! Don't wait until your research is finished. No! "Writing papers is a primary mechanism for **doing** research, not just for **reporting** it".

2. The primary goal of your research is to communicate a "useful and re-usable idea". This idea should be "clear" and "sharp". After reading your paper, the readers should be 100% sure what THIS idea is. Distill your paper into one single sentence which conveys the main idea, and make this idea explicit: "The main idea of this paper is ...", "In this section we present the main contributions of this paper." Many papers have great ideas but they didn't "distill what they are".

  - Of course, you need to convey a single idea but don't have the pressure to only present a fantastic idea. Rather, you should "write a paper, and give a talk, about any idea, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you".

{{<block class="tip">}}
Your readers should be able to sum up your paper with one single sentence: This paper finds that... 
{{<end>}}

3. The narrative flow: Here is a problem -> It's an interesting but unsolved problem -> Here is my idea (to solve it) -> My idea works (with details and data) -> Here is how my idea compares to others' approaches.

  - Abstract (4 sentences)
  - Introduction (1 page)
  - The problem (1 page)
  - My idea (2 pages)
  - The details (5 pages)
  - Related work (1-2 pages)
  - Conclusions and future work (0.5 page)

4. The introduction does two things in one page only: (1) "Describe the problem", and (2) "State your contributions". When introducing the problem, use an example! When stating your contributions, try using bullet points to make the structure clearer. 

  - Do not write this in your introduction: "The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2...." Instead, your introduction is supposed to survey the whole paper. 

5. Between *Introduction* and *The problem*, don't insert *Related work (Literature review)*. Instead, put it between *The deatils* and *Conclusions and future work*. 

6. When presenting your idea, use simple examples that even a novice can understand. 

7. Readers & Reviewers

  - When your draft is done, you can send it to the author of the paper on which your research is based. Ask them "could you help me ensure that I describe your work fairly?". Since they are interested in this, they most often will reply. 

  - Be grateful for every single word your reviewers put in the review. Treat criticism as positive suggestions that can help make your work clearer. Even if the criticism is wrong and it turns out the reviewer did not spend time and effort on understanding your (completed) work, try simplifying it!

### General advice

- Submit by the deadline
- Follow instructions by the organizer closely
- Spell check
- Use strong visual structure in your paper: sections and subsections, bullet points
- Use nice pictures/diagrams
- Use simple words and phrases

👍👍 Eisner, J. (2010). [Write the Paper First](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html).

This article is very encouraging and eye-opening for me!

The key idea of this post is that if you are planning to submit a paper to a conference, you need to write your paper right now! It's totally Okay, and even expected, if you haven't run the experiment and don't have any tangible results. You can put empty tables and figures in the Results section. **The main goal of the experiments is to allow you to put numbers in those empty tables/figures**. Remember, you should never postpone writing until your experiment is finished.

### Why?

1. Clear writing triumphs over your experimental results in terms of (1) odds of acceptance and (2) likelihood of being cited. 

2. If you complete the writing before you do the experiment, you can send it to your advisor or colleagues who can give you suggestions. If they think the idea you want to convey sucks, you don't need to waste your time actually doing the experiment. And your writing isn't a waste of time since you may find the idea applicable elsewhere. 

### What should you do?

Write the *Introduction*, where you need to present a big picture and sell your idea. Then, the *lit review*. Don't do a lit review before writing your own ideas. This is because after writing your own ideas, you can see them from a different perspective when writing the lit review. Then write the *methods*/*experimental* and even the *results* section. (The author didn't mention the *results* section. I think it is possible, though.)

Every paper needs a beautiful picture at least. But don't spend time refining it now. Simply put your sketch first. 

Remember to document your codes early on. Don't wait until your project is finished. Don't fool yourself.

The study finds that among over 1 million 15-year old students around the globe, passion predicts academic achievement, i.e., scores in science (2015), math (2012), and reading (2009), more strongly in individualistic societies than in collectivistic ones. The result remains the same after controlling for GDP per capita. Other cultural differences than individualism-collectivism are not robust predictors of the relationship between passion and academic achievement. Note that it doesn't mean passion is unimportant in collectivistic societies; Passion is still a significant predictor of academic achievement in these societies. 

Support from parents predicted academic achievements more strongly in collectivistic societies than in individualistic ones.

The authors of this opinion piece argue that partnerships between humanitarian and development organizations (HDOs) such as ICRC, UNICEF, and WHO, and academics may fail. 

1. Funding and human resources may be limited. 
  - HDOs think that universities may have their own funding for experimental studies. However, truly experimental work is not sufficient to produce products that satisfy HDOs' needs as many products are expected to be working in very harsh conditions. 
  - Researchers in universities may see HDOs as an external funding source. However, HDO funds need detailed reporting to donors. Since research needs lots of money and may not produce any tangible results at all, it's very difficult for HDO to spend many financial resources on R&D. 
  - HDO may face a lack of human resources committed to the partnerships. There is lots of paperwork to do and HDO staff already have their tasks. They may not have time to write project plans and funding reports. 

2. Deployment and sustainability
  - Products, for example, medical equipment, need training, maintenance, and upgrade services. However, the company that is tasked with producing the equipment has little interest in these. Training and maintenance needs money which normally comes from selling loads of these products. However, HDO only needs a limited number of them. This won't create profits for the company. 

  - Once the partnership produces a publication, researchers are no longer interested in it. They have to move on to other projects that produce papers. 

3. Roles, responsibilities and expectations
  - When HDOs find an interesting publication, they may invest thousands of dollars to implement it. However, there might exist a huge gap between academic publication to implementation. HDOs may waste lots of money. 

  - HDOs have a longstanding distrust in commercial sectors and believe academia is neutral. This is wrong. Universities nowadays are very commercialized. HDOs should update their view on companies and universities.

The authors of this opinion argued that a better solution to the replicability crisis in science is to shift the focus from replicating single studies to designing and conducting progressive sequences of studies that accumulate evidence on a certain topic. Researchers should be encouraged to participate in these progressive sequences of studies. Administrations of universities should shift the reward system from emphasizing single studies to these sequences of studies. Funding agencies such as NSF should do the same.

The authors web scripped close to 5,700 visualizations, among which there are 2,070 single visualizations. Then then annotated these visualizations based on their taxonomy for static visualizations (See 3 Visualization Taxonomy). They also tagged the source of each visualization, i.e., infographics, scientific publication, news, and government/world organizations. 

They selected a subset of 410 visualizations and presented them to participants on Amazon MTurk. Each visualization **is treated as an image** and is presented for only 1 second. Participants press the key if they see a visualization for the second time. Therefore, this study looks at which types of visualizations as images are more memorable. 

### Results

- If a visualization is more memorable. It is more memorable for most people. That is to say, "[T]he memorability of a visualization is a consistent measure across participants."

- The following attributes in visualizations contribute to memorability: having pictograms, colorful, chart junk, high visual densities. 

- Unique types of visualizations, such as diagrams, networks, and trees are more memorable than common types such as bar, line, and pie charts. 

- Infographic visualizations are the most memorable, followed by visualizations from scientific publications, news, and government. Scientific visualizations are memorable possibly because they contain more diagrams. 

### Further thoughts

1. How about interactive visualizations? What characteristics make interactive visualizations more memorable?

2. How about testing memorability a week after the experiment as well?

This work is exciting. 

The authors used the same dataset as in *What makes a visualization memorable?*. 393 single visualizations are selected, among which 100 are randomly chosen to be shown to participants in the **Encoding Phase**. Participants spent 10s on each visualization in this Phase. Then, in **Recognition Phase**participants are shown 200 visualizations (100 are shown before, the other 100 are filler visualizations). The duration of each visualization is 2 seconds. Participants press keys to indicate whether they have seen each visualization in the previous Phase. Lastly, in the **Recall Phase**, each participant is shown the visualizations they managed to recognize in the Recognition Phase. These visualizations are artificially blurred by the authors. Participants are asked to input any information they remember of each visualization in an empty box right next to the visualization. 

Here are what the authors find:

- If a visualization is memorable "at a glance" (where people see it for only 1 second), it is also more likely to be memorable if people see it for 10 seconds. 

- "Human recognizable objects" help make visualizations recognizable. 

- Visualizations that are the most recognizable after 1 second exposure are likely to get descriptions of the highest quality after 10-second exposure. 

- A good title helps people recall the visualization. 

- Pictograms do not hinder recall. 

- Data and message redundancy help people recognize and recall the visualization.

### How to interact with your advisor

- The fact that you like a professor's research doesn't necessarily mean that you will be comfortable working together. 

- Your advisor is your boss. When you want you to do something, do it. 

- It's better to meet your advisor regularly, for example, weekly. Remember to make an agenda for each meeting. Bring your results to the meeting. Start each meeting with the summary of points in the last meeting.

### Be productive

- To be productive, creative, and independent. 

>[T]he purpose of graduate school is research, not taking classes. Although taking classes is part of graduate school, when it comes to success, it's all about research. Do well enough in your classes but focus on publishing high quality research papers. 

- "Talk to other students". 

- Communicate with your advisor regarding your preferences of working. 

- It's better to work in the lab for at least 20 hours each week. If you cannot focus on your studies/research in the lab, talk to your advisor and find a solution. 

- Prioritize.

- If you aren't healthy or happy, you won't be productive in research. 

### Research

#### Reading papers

- Read, read, read. "Read multiple papers a week". If you are unsure of what to read, consult your advisor. 

- Take notes of every paper you read. Some need detailed notes, whereas others need simple notes. 

- When it comes to important papers in your field, read deeply. Understand them thoroughly. 

#### Research ideas

- When choosing a research topic, you need to know the literature, and the "online dialogue" within your field. 

>Try to focus on big problems rather than making incremental improvements to previous work. 

>You will be judged on what you publish, not how long it took you to come up with the idea. 

- Only work on solutions to problems that **do** exist. 

#### Results

Know why your method does not get 100% accuracy on your data. This will help you improve upon your work. 

#### Publishing

- Organize your folders, codes, texts, etc. IMMEDIATELY after a paper submission. If you don't do it then, you won't do it later either. 

- Release your codes and data after your submission/publication. 

### Talks

- Practice. Practice a lot for a talk. 

- Seek feedback/suggestions from friends/colleagues. 

- Focus on content, not form. 

- Pay attention to Timing. 

### Professional development

1. Do internships, either early one or later when you have special skill sets. It doesn't hurt to have more than one internship. 

2. Start reviewing papers in your field early on. 

3. Give talks so that others know about you and your work. Being well-known will help you find a job later. 

### Progressing in PhD

- Year 1 - Year 2/3: Take classes, find an advisor, read tons of papers, observe how others do research, finish a project with results (not necessarily a publication).

- Year 3 - Year 4/5: Choose a research area, and publish papers in that area. 

- Year 5/6: Write your thesis

### Networking

Making tutorials will help people know your name. Attend conferences frequently and introduce yourself. 

### Jobs

Know what makes you happy (industry, government, starting a company, teaching, research, eetc) and do it after your PhD.

### Timing

In the Summer a year before you graduate, complete your CV, research statement, and teaching statement. Start sending your applications to schools in the Fall a year before you graduate. You can apply through February. You probably will get interview invitations from February to early May. You'll need 3-6 recommenders, so let them know in advance. 

### Readings that might help

- *Even a Geek Can Speak*
- *Tomorrow's Professor*
- *A PhD Is Not Enough: A Guide To Survival In Science*

### Application materials

- Have a homepage. Attach a profile photo on it. Put your job materials in HTML on your site in addition to PDF. 

- Take time to tailor your cover letter to specific schools. 

- In cover letter, **bold face** faculty members. Keep the cover letter brief, around 1-2 pages. 

### Who's hiring

- Go to a conference in your field a year before you graduate and ask people whether they are hiring. 

- Mention in your homepage that you are graduating and looking for a job. 

### Job talk

- Practice 10 times before your first job talk. Practice twice for subsequent talks. 

### Miscellaneous

- Email a personalized message to everybody you talked to the next day.

- A thesis proposal is a contract. Try to make the contract as specific as possible. Remember to put in your proposal some milestones (e.g., completing literature review, complete surveys, submit for publication, etc.), dates and the completion criteria of these milestones. "The proposal needs to create the impression that failure is *unlikely*". 

>Good proposals give the impression that between one-third and two-thirds of the work remains to be completed. 

- A proposal should be around 15 pages, not longer. Limit the presentation time to 30-45 minutes.

Overview: The study finds that a redundant encoding (here, value represented with shades of gray) has no benefits nor harm for (1) accuracy and (2) speed of judgement of graphs encoded with single primary encodings (position, angle, area, length).

### Study aims
The study examines whether a redundant encoding, in this case, values represented by shades of gray, will boost or harm **accuracy** and **speed** of understanding graphs encoded with various primary encodings (position, length, angle, and area). 

The study also examines whether the additive benefit of value, if any, to accurate encodings (e.g., position) will be greater than to less accurate encodings (e.g., area).

### Results
1. Position is the most accurate encoding, followed by angle, area, and length. 
2. The redundant encodings do not have any effects on the understanding of graphs encoded with the four primary encodings. The hierarchy of accuracy with redundant encodings is the same as that with single primary encodings. 
3. Participants completed tasks on graphs with redundant encodings in the same amount of time as participants completing tasks on graphs with single primary encodings. 

### Discussions
1. Readers might have filtered out the redundant encoding, i.e., values represented with shades of gray, and focused on primary encodings of the graph. 
2. An open question: If we pair visual variables that have similar accuracy properties, for example, angle & area, will we see a boost or drop in accuracy of understanding & completing time?

### Classes
>Many students, having excelled in classes their entire academic lives, have trouble letting go of this, and need to excel in every class they take while in the PhD program. In my opinion, this is a common reason for burnout in grad school. When you go on the job market, almost no one will care what classes you took during grad school and how well you performed in them. Everyone will care about your research and what contributions you made. 

>[Classes] should come second to your research, your data, your questions. 

>The PhD program is all about learning new things, but as your research problems lead you there. 

>You might seek out a class to help you master something you know you need in research. But let the research drive that exploration and those decisions.

## Talks 
- Plan and practice your talks.

- It's Okay to (1) repeat the questioner's question and ask whether it's what they asked; and (2) wait for a second or two before you answer that question.

Key points in this essay:

- Duckworth promises in her book more than what "grit" can deliver. 

- Grit is nothing more than other personality traits, such as industriousness. 

- Grit matters but only in certain situations in life, not all of them. There is a "restriction of range". Some papers concluded that grit does not predict academic success, in New England or in Austria. 

- Grit makes some differences in life, but certainly not "all the difference in the world".

- Grit is perhaps just a rebranding, rather than producing something new. 

- It might be impossible to change your personality. 

- Being high in grit might be harmful. For example, you might hurt yourself physically if you are too focused on a goal. 

Some quotes in this essay:

>And like other self-help authors, she pulls a sleight of hand by which even widely held assumptions end up looking like discoveries. It's as important to work hard, the book contents, as it is to be a natural talent. Who would disagree with that?

>For most people, life may be less like a marathon than a series of sprints, interspersed with periods of rest and hours upon hours spent browsing the internet. 

>It's one thing to argue that grit matters more than talent or——more accurately——that your personality helps determine your success. Duckworth goes much further, asserting that you can change your personality and learn to "grow your grit."

>It could be that having too much strength of purpose is worse than having not enough.

For Americans with medical training, these two figures are 11.55% and 50%, respectively. This is surprisingly high, given that they have received formal medical training. 

- Participants in Study 2 (i.e., those who received medical training) who endorse more false beliefs report that a Black person feels less pain. These participants are also less accurate in their treatment recommendations for black targets.

- Replication crisis, especially in social and biomedical sciences
- Preregistration may not be a panacea as it discourages exploratory analyses. 
- Quotation errors: 1/5 to 1/10 scientists interpreted others' work inaccurately when citing the work
- Many retracted papers are still cited after retraction. 
- Predatory publishers are a real problem. Chances are authors are aware that the publishers are not legitimate but they go ahead anyway due to pressure to publish a lot. Also, if malicious people publish misleading work intentionally, the public will be misinformed and gradually have a lower trust in science overall. 
- arXiv papers that later published in prestigious venues attracted more citations than those found their places in less well-known journals. This indicates journals are a good gatekeeper. However, there is another side of the story: highly cited arXiv papers are less likely to be accepted for publication somewhere else at all!
- There might be a "Google Scholar bubble": less diversity in searching results; Matthew Effect

Aim: To investigate how other people's expectations of the data influence people's reactions to a visualization: ability to recall, and the trust in, the data.

Hypotheses:

- H1: Social information leads to better recall of the data shown.

- H2: Congruence in social signals leads to higher trust, and higher likelihood of updating their beliefs. 

- H3a: Congruent-HighConsensus leads to higher trust and higher likelihood to update beliefs; Incongruent-HighCnsensus leads to the opposite results. 

- H3b: HighConsensus leads to better recall of the data. 

Results:

- H1 ❌: The presence of social information has no impacts on data recall capability. 

- H2 ✔️: Congruence improves trust, and the likelihood to update beliefs. 

- H3a ❌: The level of Consensus has no impacts on trust and likelihood of belief update in both Congruent and Incongruent groups. 

- H3b ✔️: HighConsensus leads to improved recall. 

Other findings (which do not seem preregistered):

1. Social information leads to improved recall when there is high consensus in the social signal. 

2. When participants had lower trust in the data even before seeing it, they are more likely to be swayed by the social information they see: lower trust in the data when others disagree with the data, and higher trust when others agree.

This study finds that when participants hold a neutral opinion on a topic or are weakly polarized, charts lead more people to change their views compared to tables (that communicate the same data as in charts). This pattern also exists among positively polarized participants.

A reverse pattern is observed among negatively polarized participants: more people change their opinion when presented with tables. It should be pointed out that this difference is statistically significant for only one of the three topics, although when aggregating the data from all the three topics, the difference is statistically significant.

Lots of publications on misinformation are based on data from social media or websites. However, a nationally representative survey finds that (1) news is a small fraction of media consumption; (2) online news is a small fraction of news consumption; and (3) fake news is only a tiny portion of the information Americans receive. 

The authors proposed a comprehensive research agenda that aims to achieve four objectives:

1. To build a large-scale data infrastructure to study the **production** (an updated catalog of relevant information), **consumption and distribution** (to measure people's news consumption continuously across all platforms: social media, desktop, email, instant messaging, etc.), **absorption and understanding** (whether news consumption changes people's beliefs), **action and engagement** (to see whether information people receive translates into action. For example, to protest, to volunteer, or simply to follow/retweet/like/comment on social media).

2. To build a "Mass Collaboration'' Model where people can replicate and accumulate knowledge. 

3. To communicate insights obtained from research to nonacademic people. One possible approach is to create data visualizations that constantly update new data. 

4. To build an academic-industry collaboration.

I didn't totally understand the details of this paper but I got the idea. To account for the pattern of meme popularity, meme lifetime, and user activity, The combination of (i) social media structure and (ii) the limited user attention is sufficient. The authors did not prove that the values of memes are not a factor in their popularity. However, they showed that it's possible to predict the pattern of memes on Twitter without considering the intrinsic values of memes. 

Fig. 2 shows that a user's "breadth of attention" is constant despite the growing number of posts/memes in social media. 

Fig. 3 shows that people are more likely to retweet something related to what they posted in the past. This means that memory is an important factor in meme competition.

### "A conversation with the past in your field"

A research paper is "a conversation with the past in your field". **"with the past"** means you need to show the connection of your present paper to the progress made in the past; **"in your field"**  means that you need to show how your work contributes to the development in your specific academic field. 

Remember that a research paper is not a lab report, not a technical blog post, not a how-to guide to software, not a news article, not a popular science article for the non-academic folks. To be accepted, your work has to show **its connection to the past** and **its contributions to the development within your chosen specific field**. 

### "Calibrating yourself to the norms of your field"

You need to read papers in your own field published in the past five years to get an idea of how other people in your field write papers. Innovating a way to write for research papers without invitation "is not stylish, it is just rude" ([Lukeš, 2021](https://metaphorhacker.net/2021/01/the-nonsense-of-style-academic-writing-should-be-scrupulous-not-stylish/)). 

To calibrate yourself may take years. Working with your advisor can speed up this process. By observing how your advisor writes the paper, you can absorb the writing norms of your field much faster. 

It's [not very helpful to read general writing tips](https://metaphorhacker.net/2021/01/the-nonsense-of-style-academic-writing-should-be-scrupulous-not-stylish/):

> The first advice you need to give to an academic writer is not to read a book on stylish writing but rather to read how people in their field are writing. 

### Writing consistently and regularly

Don't expect a *perfect time* to write. It doesn't exist. When you write, first focus on the number of words. That's the easiest thing. Don't worry about the quality in the beginning. Just get the draft done and then you can improve it. If you expect your first few sentences to be perfect, you'll never start writing. 

### Pay close attention to the introduction

Always ask yourself, "so what?" You've done this study, so what? What problems does it solve? Why should it be published anyway? Who cares? 

The introduction should contain *the soul of your paper*. Keep tweaking it until the submission deadline. Many papers lack a soul because the writers don't spend enough time thinking/writing about the motivation and the value of their work. They submitted anyway. That's too bad. 

### Title, metadata, and abstract

Craft the title and abstract, and choose the right boxes to check (when submitting) in a way that can help your paper to be in the hands of the *right* people: scholars who have expertise in what you do. They want to see their academic lineage "carry on through the papers of newcomers like yourself". By contrast, those outside of your specific (sub)field do not appreciate your work and don't have incentives to have it published. 

### Quantity and quality

Quantity and quality aren't that different. Those who publish good work are also those who publish a lot of work. Therefore, don't procrastinate. Come up with ideas, do research, write, submit, revise, and publish. Just write! Writing will never be easy. You have to go through those *miseries* to get things done. 

### Acceptance and awards are random, but not that random

Don't submit papers you know aren't good enough. Don't waste reviewers' time. However, keep in mind that even the best work can be rejected. There is much randomness involved. 

That said, good papers always have higher chances of acceptance and winning awards.

### 1. Research statement
Research statement: 4 pages, single-spaced, 12-point, 1.25-inch margin; The first 1.5 pages to describe your previous work, the next 1.5 pages to show your future research ideas, and the last page for a bibliography. 

### 2. Scheduling interviews

- Don't let your top choice be your first interview, as you'll most likely screw up the first one. 

- Never schedule more than one interview per week. You need time to relax. 

- To avoid delays, book direct flights. 

- When travelling on the plane, you can dress your shoes and coat for the interview, in case your luggage gets lost. 

### 3. Preparing for interviews

- For your job talk, practice, practice, practice. You need to practice a lot! You can practice in front of your colleagues and friends, who can then give you suggestions for improvement. 

- For one-on-one interviews, prepare a document of *talking points*. See Section 4.2 for more details. Whenever a professor asks you questions not in this document, add this question to it. 

### 4. Interviewing

- Pay attention to and be aware of why they brought you there in the first place. Is it because your research fits into the department's future agenda? Play up these parts in your talk and individual meetings. 

- Try to *Engage*, not to *impress*. Professors interviewing you have much more research experience and publications than you do. There is no need to impress others. 

#### 4.1 Job talk
- If you cannot *hook* the audience in the first 10 minutes, chances are your talk will just be mediocre. 

- **NEVER** say anything impromptu, i.e., only say what you have practiced! And **NEVER** exceed the time limit. Professors are busy and no one wants to spend more time than necessary on your talk. You should be mindful of the time limit of your talk even when you are answering questions from the audience. 

- What your job talk is supposed to show:

  1. "Solid past research". Start with the overarching motivation before diving into two specific projects you are most proud of. 
  2. "Compelling future research". Dedicate the final 10 minutes to this part. Be bold. 
  3. Capability + Personality. Through your talk, the audience should know that you are the person who will be successful academically and you will be a chill colleague. 

- You don't need to constantly tweak your talk. 

#### 4.2 One-on-one meetings with faculty

- You are supposed to chat casually with 10-20 faculty members in the department. Each chat is around 30 minutes. 

- *Be a good listener* and *Let the other person lead*. Try to listen to and talk about **their** research, not yours. 

#### 4.3 Department chair (or Department head) meeting

This is the most important meeting you'll have. Again, **be a good listener and let the other person lead the meeting**. Try to listen to and talk about the department's future vision. You can mention how that vision connects to your future research agenda. 

#### 4.4 Dean meeting

The dean is probably not involved in the hiring decisions. So just be chill. 

#### 4.5 Graduate students meeting

**Be nice** to students. Engate, inspire, and help them!

#### 4.6 Mealtime conversations

- It's still part of the interview! 

- Never gossip about anybody. 

- Ask some questions about living in this area, like the housing price. This shows your genuine interest in working there. 

### 5. Job talk revisited

- Again, never say anything impromptu. 

- Don't linger on slides. Just click "Next"!

- When switching to the next slide, don't say anything about it before you advance to it. 

- Minimize the use of a laser pointer. 

### 6. One-on-one meeting with faculty revisited

- You can take notes while talking, but only write down key words that help you write follow-up emails later. 

- What you can write about in your follow up emails: Thanking them for being interested in your research; for giving you suggestions for your research.

- Remeber to let **the other person** lead the meeting. Be comfortable with short sliences. It's better to let them control the meeting. Be a good listener. 

- During conversations with faculty, try to make **connections** with them. When they lead the talk and talk about their research, you can mention how their studies relate to yours. 

- Why are CONNECTIONS super important? Because if there are no connections at all, they won't even remember you and won't have anything to say about you after the meeting. 

- Try HARD to appeal to your "talk mates", even if they are in totally different subfields than yours. Everyone's vote accounts in hiring decisions. You cannot afford losing anyone's vote. 

- Be open, sincere, and honest. If they ask you where you are also applying besides their institution, let them know openly. 

- There is no need to spend TOO MUCH time getting to know every one of your "talk mates" beforehand. They know you are busy and don't expect that you know about their research in detail. 

- People sign up for meetings with you for a reason. For example, they may want to collaborate with you; they want to know whether your research strengthens the department research portfolio; or that they are on the faculty search committee. Only when you let the other party lead the meeting, and be a good listener, can you know what they want from you and then adapt accordingly. 

- Follow-up emails to people you talk to are VERY important. 

### 7. Other suggestions

- Be nice to the department admin. They'll let everybody know if they really hate you. 

- Try to focus on your job search. It's very important. It's OK not to have time to do research when you are doing tons of interviews. 

- When you get the offer from the school. Don't sound demanding when you negotiate. Don't be arrogant.

Guo, P. (2016). [*What I would've wanted to know as a first-year assistant professor*](https://pg.ucsd.edu/first-year-assistant-professor.htm)

- When you become a first-year assistant professor, you'll have a lot of free time. You only need to dedicate roughly six hours per week (3 hours to teaching, and 3 hours to department and committee meetings). You are free to do whatever you want for the rest of your time each week. **This freedom is the challenge**: you have to learn how to manage this free time. 

- Tenure. From the first day of your job, you have about five years to build up your publication list, submit your material in the sixth year, and hopefully get tenure. To get tenure, you need (1) to get recommendation letters from full professors detailing why you are the best in the field you are in; and (2) to have good relationships with tenured colleagues in your department so that they will interpret the recommendation letters in the most favorable light. For the first requirement, if your research is super innovative, then you risk not being able to find enough recommenders in your "field". 

- Even though tenure is a big thing, you shouldn't wishfully think that things will be better after you get tenure. Also, don't do something you don't enjoy simply to get tenure with the hope that you can do what you really love after tenure. Rather, be true to yourself, do what you love *right now*, and have a lifestyle you desire *right now*. 

- Back to time management, the key is to **prioritize**. Even though your life as a professor seems free, you have tons of things to do. Your time and energy is limited, so you have to prioritize the most important things and give up other no-so-important things. Otherwise, you won't have focused attention and energy to do your job well. 

- No need to be stressed out by tenure. It's easier to get tenure than to get fired as faculty.

This paper is very different from many papers I read, possibly because the author is an employee of the government. It aims to provide information for researchers interested in one topic, rather than to show a scientific result obtained through the author's research.

### Study 1

- Purpose: To see whether mistaken belief is sufficient to explain the sharing of misinformation. 

- Procedure: 1015 participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants are presented with headlines, lead sentences, and images for 36 news stories obtained from social media. Half of these stories were entirely false and the other half are true. Half of the headlines are favorable to Democrats and the other half favorable to Republicans. Participants were randomly assigned to decide either the veracity of the headline they saw (accuracy condition) or their intention to share the story (sharing condition).

- Results: 

  - In the accuracy condition, true headlines are rated as accurate significantly more often than false headlines. Whereas politically concordant headlines are rated as accurate more than politically discordant headlines, this difference stemming from political alignment is significantly smaller than the veracity-driven difference. 

  - In the sharing condition, the difference in sharing intention based on political alignment is significantly larger than the veracity-driven difference. 

  - Across conditions: the effect of headline veracity is significantly larger in the accuracy condition than in the sharing condition; the effect of political alignment is significantly larger in the sharing condition than in the accuracy condition. 

There is a disconnect between accuracy rating and sharing intention: even though very few Republicans rated a headline as accurate in the accuracy condition, many Republicans in the sharing condition intend to share it. This disconnection disputes the confusion theory (which states that people share misinformation because they do not know the information is false): People can detect the falsehood, but decide to share it nonetheless.

People do care about veracity when deciding whether to share or not, according to a study (Coppock & McClellan, 2019). Then, why do people knowingly share misinformation? The authors of the current study formulate the idea that the context of social media primed people to please followers or signal their membership.

### Study 3 & Study 4

Control condition: participants are shown 24 news headlines (half true & half false; half favorable to Democrats & half favorable to Republicans) and asked how likely they are to share each headline on Facebook. 

Treatment condition: participants are asked to rate the accuracy of **one single non-partisan** news headline at the start of the experiment and then go on to go through the same procedure as in the control condition. 

As shown in Figure 2, participants in the treatment condition are significantly less likely to consider sharing false news headlines than those in the control condition. This treatment effect is significantly larger for politically concordant headlines than for politically discordant news. However, participants in the two conditions are equally likely to consider sharing true headlines. 

In Study 3, the difference in sharing intention for veracious versus fake headlines is 2.0 times bigger in the treatment condition relative to the control condition. This figure is 2.4 in Study 4. 

In both studies, participants in both conditions when asked after the experiment do not differ significantly in how important it is to share only veracity.

### Study 5

A more representative group of participants are recruited through Lucid. 

Besides the two conditions in Study 3 & 4, there are also an active condition (in which participants are asked to rate the humorousness rather than the veracity of a single news headline before the experiment) and an importance treatment condition (in which participants before the experiment are asked about the importance they attached to only sharing true content). The results replicated those in Study 3 and 4. See Fig. 2-c. 

As Fig. 3 a-c shows, there exists a positive correlation between the perceived accuracy (rated categorically as 1-7, with 7 indicating the most accurate) and the treatment effect in Study 3, 4, & 5. For each headline, the treatment effect is measured as the `$Sharing intention_{treatment condition} - Sharing intention_{control condition}$`.

This positive correlation means that the least accurate news headlines are the ones that the "accuracy salience treatment" discouraged people from sharing the most. 

Study 7: I do not understand it. It seems that this part is written by a different person. But I know the conclusion of Study 7: the accuracy message led Twitter users who frequently share misinformation to increase the quality of the content they share. 

Overall, this article supports the idea that shifting people's attention to accuracy discourages them from sharing misinformation.

I agree. The most important thing about writing is getting the first draft down, even with tears on your face. Don't procrastinate. Don't expect the first draft to be elegant. You just need to get enough words, which will make you less anxious (as you now have a draft, as shitty as it is). Then you can spend more time later editing it.

I read only PP. 32-33. 

The trick here is that you need to separate *generating* text from *editing*. These two activities involve different activities. 

When generating texts, don't look at the words you've produced, and don't think about the quality. Just write down what's in your mind. *Editing* is another job you'll do later, not now. 

After generating enough texts, then you can edit them.

- People tend to post positive things in their Rinsta (i.e., real Instagram accounts) and negative (but authentic) things in their Finsta (i.e., false Instagram accounts). They want to present a polished and emotional-free self on their Rinsta. Self-presentation can be coarse and emotional on Finsta. People might also talk about taboo activities on their Finsta. 

- People treat Rinsta and Finsta differently because they are targeting different audiences. 

- Since people might have multiple accounts in the same social media and use these accounts differently, surveying people their experiences of using this medium might lead to wrong conclusions.

- As an author, you should shoulder the responsibility of **convincing the reader of the contribution of your work**.

- Some reviewers may conclude that your paper should be rejected before they read all of your content. Therefore, their criticism will only be for the first few pages. It is wrong to conclude that they are satisfied with the remaining part of your paper. 

- If reviewers comment that your work lacks a thorough literature review, you should not assume that adding some references will solve the problem. This kind of criticism implies that they don't think your work is important in the context of extant research. 

- Reviewers might send confidential comments to editors and associated editors, which are invisible to you. 

- If your paper is rejected by a journal and you decide to submit it to another journal after revision, you should send a note to the editor explaining the history of your work. Do not simply do "journal shopping". 

- Be objective, emotionally detached, and friendly in your response to reviewers' comments. No matter how offended you feel, do not insult reviewers' competence or their motives. Be "gracious, humble, and constructive".

- If reviewers do not appear to understand your paper, take the responsibility, explain, clarify, and educate, rather than attacking reviewers' competence. 

- Even if you feel a criticism is unjustified, and no revision for it is necessary, it's better to make relevant changes according to the criticism and describe your improvements. You can make your points clearer if you feel they are correct, rather than arguing no revision is needed, which sounds arrogant to the reviewers. 

- In your response, use different fonts to distinguish between quoting reviewers, your reply, and quoting text in your revised paper.

- Experiment 2: Showing people information about variability in individual outcomes alleviates people's overestimation of treatment effectiveness when presented only with mean differences (which was conveyed through 95% CI with visualizations, the most misleading format in Experiment 1). Among all methods to convey outcome uncertainty, telling people directly the probability of superiority is the most effective (at alleviating overestimation).  

- Experiment 3: Combining the method of "telling people directly probability of superiority" with any of the other four methods (category, variance, height analogy, and weather analogy) did not statistically significantly reduce people's willingness to pay. Adding additional information did not have negative impacts either (except when weather analogy was applied). 

- Experiment 4: Even if mean differences are conveyed through four other methods (in Experiment 1) rather than 95% CI with visualizations, telling people afterwards directly probability of superiority reduces their willingness to pay, compared to when showing people only *inferential uncertainty* through 95% CI with visualizations.

- Outcome uncertainty is more useful for individuals than inferential uncertainty. The former is predicting what an individual outcome is likely to be, whereas the latter one shows the group average. It's possible that the group with a larger mean has more variability, whereas the other group (with a smaller mean) is more reliable. Wise people will choose the second one rather than the first one.

   - Cohen's *d*, expressed as `$d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma}$`, conveys information about both the treatment effect and the variability in individual outcomes.

- People tend to overestimate the effect size and understated the variability in outcomes when presented 95% confidence intervals that show *inferential* uncertainty, compared to when presented 95% prediction intervals that show *outcome* uncertainty. 

  For example, suppose we are comparing heights of men with those of women: 

    - *Inferential* uncertainty is how confident we are about our estimation of **each group's average height**, based on **our measurement**. So error bars will extend 1.96 (sometimes 1.0) *standard error* above and below the mean. 

    - *Outcome* uncertainty is the variability of **each individual's height around their group's mean**. Therefore, error bars will extend 1.96 (sometimes 1.0) *standard deviation* above and below the mean. 

  See Fig. 1 for illustration. 

- People have the largest misperceptions when the effect size is small. Unfortunately, small effect sizes are the norm in scientific studies, which use 95% CI more often than 95% PI. This indicates that readers are likely to exaggerate the scientific results they encounter.

Artificial intelligence is powered by deep learning, which are algorithms that use statistics to identify patterns in data. This capability enables computers to mimic human skills, and to provide recommendations to users (for example, in Google, Facebook, and Netflix).

Papers in arXiv's artificial intelligence section focused on machine learning in around 1995-2005, on neural networks in around 2010-2015, and on reinforcement learning in around 2015-2019. 

Before around 2005, papers in arXiv's AI section focused on "knowledge-based reasoning", trying to recreate human seasoning using man-made rules. After around 2005, the attention changed to machine learning, which is a parent term that includes deep learning. Rather than writing rules, machine learning trains computer programs to extract rules from a sea of data.

Besides neural networks, there are other machine learning methods, for example, "bayesian networks”, "markov methods”, and "support vector machines", but neural networks have dominated the playground since around 2016. 

Three types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning wasn't a new idea, but it didn't gain much momentum until AlphaGo's groundbreaking success.

People overestimated both error and variance of effect size when only told the mean differences. 95% confidence intervals with visualizations led to the largest overestimation, as shown in Figure 2. Presending the mean differences in absolute or percentage terms, or simply telling people difference exists, made people overestimate the effect size as well, but to a lesser degree.

Informing people the variability helped alleviate this issue, with directly telling people the probability of superiority performing the best (although the difference did not reach statistical significance).

- As Fig. 1(B) shows, the percentage of publications in both *Nature* and *Physical Review D* by new PIs have been decreasing in the past two decades. The figure also shows that different types of journals have different patterns regarding the share of papers by different categories of PIs. 

- Chaperone effect `$C$` is measured as

   `$$ c / c_{random} $$`

   where `$c$` is the ratio of **the number of authors who became last authors from non-last authors** to **the number of those who never made this transition**. `$c_random$` is the same ratio but in a system where the order of authors is randomly permuted. This randomization is necessary if we want to compare the chaperone effect of different scientific fields. If we measure the chaperone effect by `$c$` rather than `$C$`, we fail to consider the fact that `$c$` might be influenced by individual productivity, team size, or simply random factors. 

   If `$C$` is larger one 1, then the chaperone effect exists. 

- Fig. 2 shows that the chaperone effect is strongest in interdisciplinary fields, biology, and medicine, and weakest in Mathematics. 

- An interesting question to ask is whose papers have more impact, those by new PIs, or those by chaperoned and established PIs. The authors assumed that those by new PIs have more impact because it is difficult to publish in a journal, say, in *Nature*, if you didn't have a publication record there. However, results show that papers by established and chaperoned PIs receive more citations. 

- The chaperone effect is stronger in prestigious, interdisciplinary journals with a general audience than in field-specific journals.

- As can be seen in [Fig. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/118/4/e2016976118/F1.large.jpg), both current happiness (experienced well-being) and remembered happiness (evaluative well-being) grow linearly with **log(income)**, **without a plateau**. 

- Larger household income below $80,000 had a stronger correlation with decreased negative feelings compared to people having household income above $80,000. Positive feelings grow evenly across the income range. 

- Sense of control of one's life explained 74% of the relationship between income and experienced well-being. 

- People having smaller household income were happier if they attributed less importance to money; Those who earned a lot were happier if they attributed more importance to money. 

- Across the income range, the more people equated money and success, the less happier they felt. 

- The main difference of this study is that 1) respondents responded in real time when they saw the prompts from the app; 2) happiness was measured using a continuous rather than dichotomous scale.

- Without considering any other factors, self-efficacy is positively related to salary in initial jobs. 

- For engineering and CS undergraduates, in their first jobs after they graduate, women's salaries are lower than men's. 

- Gender does not predict how important salary is to a person. 

- Women do emphasize workplace culture more, but this emphasis is associated with higher rather than lower compensation. 

- Self-efficacy is a significant mediator for the relationship between being female and the salary. (See [Figure S5](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2020/11/11/2010269117.DCSupplemental/pnas.2010269117.sapp.pdf))

- Self-efficacy influences whether a person intends to enter jobs related to engineering and computer science.

This paper investigates why there is a gender pay gap among STEM graduates. They hypothesized that engineering self-efficacy (ESE) is the reason. To test this hypothesis, they surveyed 559 college students majoring in engineering and computer science in 2015 (when students are still enrolled in the program), 2016, and later in 2017 when students just graduated and entered the workforce. 

### Theories 

Two possible reasons why women earn less: 1) women are socialized to believe money is not as important as family; 2) women prefer inclusive environments to competitive ones, with the latter more favorable to higher salaries.

Andrasfay, T., & Goldman, N. (2021). Reductions in 2020 US life expectancy due to COVID-19 and the disproportionate impact on the Black and Latino populations. *PNAS, 118*(5).

- The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to cause a decline in 2021 US life expectancy by 1.13 y. This decline is larger than that in other developed countries, which already had higher life expectancy than the US before the pandemic. 

- The reduction in life expectancy in the US is not the same for each racial group. The reduction for Black (2.10 y) and Latino (3.05 y) is much larger than that for Whites (0.68 y). 

- For Black and Latino populations, younger people face a higher burden of mortality related to the COVID-19. This might be because their jobs are less compatible with remote working and therefore they have to expose themselves to viruses to earn money during the pandemic. 

- These racial differences in reduction in life expectancy will result in 39% increase in the life expectancy gap between the Black population and Whites (from 3.6 y in 2017 to 5.06 y in 2020). The life expectancy advantage that Latino population has relative to Whites will decrease from 3.3 y in 2017 to 0.93 y in 2020, a 70% plunge.

This study tries to answer **why some people are more likely than others to experience the presence of gods and spirits**. In four studies, the authors, possibly among others, interviewed and surveyed local residents having faith (in charismatic evangelical Christianity or the local religion) and urban undergraduate students in four places: US, Ghana, Thailand and China. 

The study found that **porosity** and **absorption** played distinct roles in people's spiritual experiences across different cultures and religions. 

**Porosity** is a cultural attribution that defines the boundary between "mind" and the "world". People living in cultures of different levels of porosity might have different viewpoints on whether their mental experiences come from and have influences on the outside world. 

**Absorption** is a personal tendency to be immersed in their own minds.

- 98,847 people registered to participate in a "global search" task. They were to reach the person assigned to them via email. To do so, they were asked to relay the message to people they think are "closer" to their target. Receivers of the relayed message were asked to do the same thing. 18 targets were from the US, Estonia, Indian, Australia and Norway. 

- 61,168 people from 166 countries relayed the message, generating 24,163 message chains. More than half of these people were middle class and college educated North Americans. (Background information: the study was published in 2003.)

- Two reasons stood out when people were asked why they sent a message to specific recipients: geographical proximity, and similar occupation. 

- Hubs were not important for the success of searches.

- Weak ties are important. 

- It is important that people have incentives to proceed or confidence in the search; otherwise, it's difficult to reach the target.

The authors proposed a model: "container model". This model, if given the trajectories of an individual, can infer the hierarchical levels of the mobility traces, and the size of each level. Based on the mobility traces of more than 700K people, the authors found that the mobility of these people has four hierarchical levels. This means that day-to-day human mobility is not scale-free. However, when we aggregate displacements across containers (I do not fully understand what this means, though), human mobility is scale-free. 

Fig. 2 shows that container models do a much better job than other models in predicting mobility traces.

The authors got access to detailed cell records data of 1.5 million subscribers in Rwanda. They did a phone survey involving 856 individuals, who were among the 1.5 million subscribers. The authors built a model that can predict an individual's wealth based on these 856 individuals' answers and their cell records. The authors used this model to predict the wealth of Rwanda by district and found that it very well matched the actual wealth index as computed from a national survey of over 10k households in Rwanda. 

The authors argued that administering a national survey is very slow and costly. Predicting wealth from cell phone data is fast and relatively cheap. This method is accessible because a considerable number of people in developing countries are using cell phones now.

Does exposure to social media increase or decrease belief polarization? This study tries to answer this question via a field experiment lasting for one and a half months on Twitter. The authors hired a company to recruit Twitter users who identify themselves as Republicans and Democrats. 1652 people participated in the study (901 Democrats and 751 Republicans). 

Later, participants were invited to follow a Twitter bot that would retweet 24 messages/day for a month. The bot was designed to retweet counterattitudinal messages to the participants, i.e., Democrats would be assigned to a conservative bot and Republicans to a liberal bot. Participants did not know what types of bots they were going to be assigned to. Among those invited to follow a bot, 64.9% of Democrats and 57.2% of Republicans accepted the invitation. 

[Fig. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/37/9216/F1.large.jpg) provides an excellent summary of the experiment procedure.

- Social networks of those following pages of Places of Worship, Community Amenities, Bars and Pubs, Indoor Recreation, and Performing Arts had two types of members: core members who are closely connected with each other, and other members who are loosely-connected. This is called a "core-periphery structure". A network with this structure indicates that there are "regulars" who visit the place often. Non-regulars tend to be friends of a "regular". 

- The fact that people do similar things in two places does not mean that the two social networks have more similarities. For example, the friendship network of Bars and Pubs is closer to that of Community Amenities than to that of Restaurants.

### Publication trends

- The use of question or exclamation marks in paper titles is increasing (< 1% in 1950 to >3% in 2013).

- The percentage of papers with authors listed in an alphabetical order more than halved, from 21.0% in 1950 to 43.5% in 2014.

- Paper abstracts are getting longer, from a mean of 116.3 words in 1970 to 179.8 words in 2014.

- Self-citation: both the number of self-citations and the percentage of papers containing self-citations increased. 

- The mean and median length of academic papers decreased: 14.4 pages in 1950, 10.1 in 1990, and 8.4 in 2014. 

### Author trends

- Early-career scientists now are publishing more papers but are less likely to be the first authors, compared to those decades ago. 

### Journal trends

- Both the number of journals and the number of papers published per journal each year increased. 

- For papers in top journals, the mean career age of first and last authors and the percentage of returning authors increased. 

### Discussions

- The majority of the observed changes mentioned above are correlated with more academic citations. 

{{<block reminder>}}
Here, the two authors said that "These results support our hypothesis that the citation number has become a target." 

I am a little bit doubtful of this conclusion. Although it seems true instinctively, it does call for casual data. I do not think they can reach this conclusion only by observing a correlation between the discussed trends and the number of citations.

- Scientific papers that appeared in policy documents received on average 40 times more citations from other scientific papers than those not found in policy documents. This indicates that papers referenced in government policy documents were also well received and respected in the scientific community. 

- Although preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, and SSRN) released much more papers on the COVID-19, papers published in peer-reviewed journals appeared more frequently in policy documents. See Fig. 2.3. 

- Policy documents grounded in rigorous scientific findings received more citations from other policy documents. 

- National governments produced more policy documents than think tanks and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), but they cited science the least. IGOs, especially WHO, used science the most.

### Aim of the study
To explain why success in the cultural market is different from average performance and yet very difficult to anticipate even for experts. 

### Study design:

- 14,341 participants were recruited from a teen-interest website. They were randomly assigned to two conditions (independent vs. social influence) and rated 48 songs by different bands. 
  - In the independent condition, participants were only shown the name of the bands and the songs. After listening to a song, they were asked to rate it; the rating ranged from 1 to 5. After rating, they were given the choice to download the song, although they were not required to do so. 

  - In the social influence condition, participants also saw how many times a song has been downloaded by previous participants. 

  - There were eight "worlds" to which participants in the social influence condition were assigned to. Each world is parallel to each other, meaning that the number of downloads in one world does not affect other worlds. 

- The authors of this paper conducted two experiments. 

  - In experiment 1, 48 songs were presented in a `$16 \times 3$` grid where the order of the songs was random. In experiment 1, participants in the social condition saw the number of downloads along with the name of the band whereas participants in the independent condition did not see this information. 

  - In experiment 2, songs were presented in a single column. For participants in the social condition in experiment 2, the songs were shown in descending order of current downloaded counts, whereas the order was random for participants in the independent condition in experiment 2. 

  - Why did the authors conduct two experiments? Through this design, in each experiment, the authors can see the effects of social influence on the success of each song. Furthermore, they can see the effect of increased "strength" of related information signals (i.e., downloaded numbers) by comparing the results of two experiments (for the social influence condition). 

### Results

Social influence, i.e., information about the choice of others, contributed to both **inequality** and **unpredictability** of the songs. 

  - [Fig. 1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/311/5762/854/F1.large.jpg) shows that there is more inequality when social influence is present. This is because, as we can see, the dark bars are consistently taller than the light bars. It also shows that an increased level of social influence leads to increased level of inequality. 

  - Fig. 2 shows that as social influence increases, it becomes more unpredictable to tell whether a song turns out to be good or bad.

- Is it possible that the above mentioned epidemiological patterns were due to increasing testing capacity rather than travel restrictions?

The authors of the paper introduced a binary variable of testing capacity, whose value was "low" before 2020-01-20, the date when COVID-19 was categorized as a class B notifiable disease, and "high" after 2020-01-20. Compared to the naive model (see the end of p.1 of the paper for detail regarding this model), inclusion of human mobility data from Wuhan alone led to improvements in the model's prediction for 12 provinces (among 27 provinces that reported cases through 2020-02-06). In 10 other provinces, both testing capacity and human mobility from Wuhan improved prediction. Only for Hunan did testing alone contributed the most to the model's prediction. Therefore, the authors concluded that although testing capacity is important, in the early stage of the epidemic, Wuhan lockdown was the most important "driver of spread" (p. 3).

I admire this work.

- The volume and frequency of human movement from Wuhan to other places in China predicted the size of the early epidemic in other provinces.

- After 2020-02-01, daily case counts became less correlated with human movement from Wuhan. This indicates that variability among different places in daily case counts was more likely due to factors other than human mobility from Wuhan before the Wuhan lockdown. This also indicates that travel restrictions are important in the early phase of epidemic control, but later, the importance of other local mitigation methods increased. 

- From 2020-01-09 to 2020-01-22, variation in the epidemic's growth rate in provinces outside of Hubei was almost entirely explained by human mobility from Wuhan. After drastic control measures were taken across China, growth rates became negatively correlated with human movement from Wuhan; that is to say, provinces with more human mobility from Wuhan before the lockdown saw smaller growth rates.

- Is it possible that the above mentioned epidemiological patterns were due to increasing testing capacity rather than travel restrictions?

Continued with Sinatra et al. (2016)

The *Q*-model corrected the two shortcomings of the *R*-model. 

According to the Q-model:

- A paper's potential impact `$p_\alpha$` is independent of a scientist's productivity `$N_i$` and parameter `$Q_i$`, which means that there is luck behind the impact. 

- High *Q* is only slightly correlated with higher *N*. 

Then the question is, what the hidden parameter of *Q* is, and what it indicates? According to the authors, *Q* is a constant ability to turn a project with randomly picked impact into high-impact. For each scientist, this ability is **a constant** (for 76% of all scientists); it does not grow with the development of the career stage. 

PP. 5-7

## 2020-12-23
Continued with Sinatra et al. (2016)

So, what is the role of a scientist's ability in impact generation?

The authors first created a **Random-impact model (R-model)**. This model assumes that no matter for whom, the impact of each scientific paper is randomly chosen from the same impact distribution `$P(c_{10})$`. Then, the only difference scientists is **productivity `$N$`**: how many papers she gets published in her career. This model accurately predicts the cumulative function of `$P(\ge N^*/N)$` (Fig. 2E). However, this model has two problems:

1. If each paper's impact is randomly selected from a universal distribution of `$P(c_{10})$`, then a scientist with a higher `$N$` will be more likely to have a higher `$c^*_{10}$`, i.e., the citation of the highest impact paper. However, the R-model fails to predict this. See Fig. 3C. 

2. Scientists with a higher average impact without `$c^*_{10}$` will also score higher on `$c^*_{10}$`. That is to say, high impact papers are more likely to be produced by a scientist with a constantly high impact. Again, the R-model fails to predict this. See Fig. 3D. 

The authors then proposed an alternative model, **Q-model**. This model assumes that (1) as in the R-model, each paper's impact is randomly selected from a universal distribution of `$P(c_{10})$`, and (2) each scientist `$i$` has a unique value `$Q_i$` that modulates impact. `$Q_i$` is a constant throughout a scientist's career. The impact of a paper published by a scientist `$i$` is the product of `$Q_i$`, and `$p_\alpha$` randomly drawn from the distribution `$P(p)$` which is the same for all scientists .

- Fig. 2E: The random impact rule is further confirmed by Fig. 2E. This figure captures the cumulative distribution of `$P(\ge N^*/N)$`, where `$N^*/N$` denotes when the highest-impact paper of a scientist occurs. The fact that it is a straight line indicates that the highest-impact factor can appear anytime within a scientist's career. 

- Fig. 2A: We can clearly see the differences in impacts across three levels impact scientists. What's the reason behind it: increasing productivity or increasing creativity? The authors again randomized the papers' impact while keeping scientists' productivity unchanged. The results for both high- and low- impact scientists remained unchanged. Therefore, differences in scientists can be better explained by productivity (see Fig. 1E)

P. 3

## 2020-12-21
Continued with Sinatra et al. (2016)

- A first look at Fig. 2D might tell us that the chance to publish the highest-impact paper drops with age. However, when the impact of papers was randomized, while keeping a scientist's productivity each year unchanged, the distribution of the timing of `$t^*$` remains almost the same. This is a very important finding, as it means that a scientist can produce her highest impact paper **anytime** in her career. 

P.3 

{{<block class="note">}}
I am not sure whether it's only the order of a scientist's papers that was randomized or that the order remains unchanged but papers' `$c_{10}$` were randomized. The authors did not make this point crystal clear.

- Productivity and impact are metrics to gauge a scientist's performance. 

- Fig. 1B: Only 5% of all the scientists analyzed have at least one paper that received 200 or more citations after its publication. 

- Fig. 1C and 1E: High impact scientists are also much more productive. Medium impact scientists started with more publications than the other two groups (high and low impact). In the first three years following the first publication, medium impact scientists have more publications than the other two groups, but high impact scientists quickly catch up: it took ten more years for the medium impact scientists to have the same number of publications as high impact scientists, and the figure for low impact scientists is 40 more years. 

- For a scientist, the timing of the highest-impact paper is truly uniform within the career, meaning that he or she can do ground-breaking work anytime within his or her academic career.

One point worth noticing is that the negative effect of susceptibility to believing in false rumors on vaccine acceptance is stronger than the positive effect of exposure to fact-checked vaccination-related information.

## 2020-12-16

Continued with Singh et al. (2020)

### Research question

Whether (1) exposure to false rumors, (2) exposure to these false rumors' fact-checks, and (3) the perceived believability of each rumor ("believability") are related to the willingness to get vaccinated ("vaccine acceptance"). 

### Methods 

From 2020-06-18 to 2020-07-13, the study survey was promoted in five languages (English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Arabic) on Facebook Advertising Platform. More than 44k Facebook users from 152 countries did the survey. The authors discarded (1) incomplete and duplicated responses, and (2) responses from countries with fewer than 30 respondents. The final dataset is over 805k responses from over 18k people in 40 countries. 

The survey was quite simple, as it only comprised of three questions:

>1. Have you seen or heard this information in the past month? 
>2. Have you ever seen an official source confirming or denying this claim?
>3. How believable does this information seem to you?

At the end of the survey, the respondents were also asked to provide demographic information, and to indicate the extent they saw the coronavirus as a threat ("perceived threat").

### Results

1. Exposure to misinformation, and perceived threat are positively related to believability. 

2. Exposure to misinformation alone is not strongly correlated with vaccine acceptance. However, the believability of false information is **negatively** correlated with vaccine acceptance. 

3. Exposure to **vaccine-related misinformation** is positively correlated with vaccination hesitancy, and the believability of false **vaccine-related rumors**. Exposure to fact-checked vaccination-related information is positively correlated with vaccine acceptance. 

4. Exposure, believability, and fact-checking of other types of false rumors are not correlated with vaccine acceptance. 

5. Perceived threat is positively correlated with vaccine acceptance.

Major findings: 1) Even though more journal articles published long ago became available online, scientists tend to cite more recent papers; 2) Even though more articles are becoming online, fewer journals and articles are being cited, and citations become concentrated on fewer journals and articles.

Evans (2008) explains that this might be because scholars find it easier to locate prevailing opinions if they search online. Journals and articles that scholars might skim in the print age now are overlooked, pushing the citation to newer and fewer articles. This is alarming because it indicates that as online journals become more available, scientific studies are building upon fewer, rather than more, ideas.

The title of this paper explains the main finding. One point worth noticing is that, as the authors mentioned at the end of the paper, fundings from the government for individuals or small teams do not enable smaller teams to produce disruptive results. This is because small teams funded by the government don't want to take the risk of entering uncharted areas. 

This paper explains my intuition: more and more scientists, and more and more money invested in research, do not necessarily mean more ground-breaking results. Also, I don't believe large teams should always dominate the science community. I also don't think it's a good idea to always promote publications with a massive number of individuals. Teamwork is great, but does not always produce disruptive work.

Key question: technologies give people more choices regarding consuming news. How does this affect the overall news consumption pattern? Do audiences become more fragmented (i.e., "audiences disperse among the higher number of choices")?

Conclusions:

1. Selective exposure exists but it does not grow in magnitude amongst increasing choices of news content.

2. The pattern and effect of consuming news on desktop are different than that of consuming news on multiplatform, with the later reaching increasingly larger audiences, attracting more time spent on news consumption, and making audiences less fragmented. 

3. More than half of the US population access little to no news. These people might also be susceptible to misinformation.

Study design:

Data about family and children were available only for waves 1-5 (from child birth to age 9) but not available yet for wave 6 (child age 15). Researchers tried to predict the results (child GPA, child grit, household eviction, household material hardship, caregiver layoff, and caregiver participation in job training) of wave 6 based on the whole data for waves 1-5 and half of the data for wave 6. 

Result:

Scientists leveraging complicated machine learning algorithms could not predict those outcomes correctly. If a score of 1 means perfectly accurate, and 0 not accurate at all, the best predictions got a score of 0.2 for material hardship and child GPA, and only 0.05 for the other four outcomes. Also note that a linear regression or logistic regression model with only four variables chosen by domain experts were only slightly worse than the best submission, and were much better than most of the other submissions.

2. Limitations of this model?

### Methods
Participants on Facebook answered five tie strength questions for as many friends as possible within half an hour, ending up with 2184 Facebook friendships rated. 

The five questions are: How strong is the relationship, how comfortable to ask for a loan, how helpful if looking for a job, how upset if unfriended, and how important to bring a friend to a new channel if need be. (See Table 2)

Independent variables: The researchers then used 74 Facebook variables (such as Wall and words in the *inbox*) to predict intensity, intimacy, duration, reciprocal services, structure, emotional support, and social distance. (See Table 1) Participants also answered questions regarding their demographic and Facebook usage, and their friends' Facebook  usage.

Many papers on the strength of weak ties do not answer the question of whether weak ties carry **important** or **novel** information.

To answer this question, we can test whether users pay more attention to information travelled through a weak tie. But how can we measure "attention"? A reasonable proxy is the number of friends a user has in a social network.

### Central question
Does information exchange in bipartisan communication networks increase or decrease partisan bias?

### Literature
What is the drawback of previous studies: people had conversations, so that researchers could not distinguish between the effect of partisan priming, and that of opposing views. 

### Design & Procedure

Four groups:

A control group in which participants had **the same** political ideology;

Group 2, 3, and 4 are all structured social networks with an equal number of conservatives and liberals. Group 2 were only shown the average of their 4 network neighbors, without any other information exhibited. Group 3 were shown the average of their neighbors plus the logos of political parties. Group 4 were shown the average as well, along with the neighbors political identity. 

Each group provided estimates for three times. For the first round, each member estimated independently. 

In Round 2 and Round 3, the control group revised their answers independently. Group 2 revised their answers while being exposed to their neighbors' average answer. Group 3 revised their answer while being exposed to Republican and Democratic party logos below their neighbors' average estimate. Group 4 revised their response while being shown the usernames, political identification, and the average of each of their four neighbors, and the average of these four neighbors' answers.

### Results
Group 2: both liberals and conservatives improved their trend accuracy, with an elimination of partisan bias in interpreting climate change data. Even conservatives in this group predicted trends significant more accurately than liberals in the control condition. 

Group 3: there was no effect of social learning, and belief polarization in Round 1 was maintained. 

Group 4: trend accuracy improved but moderate belief polarization remained. 

(Belief polarization means that liberals significantly outperformed conservatives in predicting climate change trends.) 

- Exposure to logos of political parties had a stronger effect on decreasing the impact of social learning than exposure to neighbors' political identity. 

- Both conservatives and liberals improved their prediction accuracy thanks to information exchange in networks, even when exposed to their network neighbors' political identification. 

### Robustness check
Can social learning reduce polarization in homogeneous networks (i.e., networks that are not bipartisan)? Robustness tests showed that **the effect of social learning was reduced in politically homogeneous networks**: by Round 3, trend accuracy of conservatives in these echo chambers did not differ significantly from conservatives in the control condition. 

{{<block class="reminder">}}
Considering this result, instead of saying the effect of social learning was **reduced**, I think it's more accurate to say it was **removed**.
{{<end>}}

Another question is whether the effect of social learning remains if participants in Group 4 were shown individual answers rather than an average. Results showed that the effect of social learning was robust to exposure to individual responses.

{{<block class="reminder">}}
I am very puzzled by the result. It showed that the effect of social learning was eliminated in homogeneous networks, but the paper of *the wisdom of partisan crowds* showed exactly [the opposite result](/en/apad/#2020-11-16-edited-on-2020-11-19-and-2020-11-20).

### Conclusion & suggestion
It's better to have political discussions in bipartisan networks without partisan cues.

- Complex contagions require a critical mass to start a large-scale cascade and critical mass is dependent on network topology, node degree distribution, and adoption thresholds. 

New directions:

1. Ecologies of complex contagions: how several contagions interact with each other within a network and across networks. 

{{<block class="note">}}

The following were added on 2020-11-22

2. Heterogeneity of thresholds

Thresholds of contagions vary. Different people and different activities may have different thresholds. 

3. Homophily and diversity in diffusion

Identity-based diversity means one's neighbors have different characteristics. Structural diversity means one's neighbors belong to different components of the network. The first kind of diversity **reduces** the spreading of complex contagions whereas the second one **amplifies** it.

If one has too many friends, he or she might not be an ideal target of complex contagions. This is because complex contagions need multiple reinforcement. When you have too many friends, you receive fewer repeated exposure. Therefore, "clustered, homophilous networks" are conducive to complex contagions. 

  - How do people infer global structure from their local interactions?
  - How do future social media networks facilitate (or reduce?) these inferences by giving people more (or less?) information about their broader ego network?

**Aim**: to see whether there is "wisdom of crowds" in politically homogeneous networks. 

**Experiment design**: 

Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: control condition vs social condition. They were asked to provide an answer to a question for three times (rounds):

- Participants in the control condition provided the answer independently for three times. 

- Those in the social condition answered independently in Round 1. In Round 2, they were shown the average answer of four other participants connected to them in a social network and then updated their answer. In Round 3, they were shown the average of the updated answers of four other participants connected to them (same in Round 2) and provided a final answer to the question. 

- A network consists of 35 participants who share the same political orientation (either Democrats or Republicans). Participants in the network **did not** know that other people in the network had the same partisan preference as theirs. 

- The researchers tested four questions. Each question was answered by 3 network groups and 1 control group for each political party. 

Results of Experiment 1: Information exchange in homogeneous networks increased accuracy for both party members and decreased belief polarization. 

Individual learning (being able to edit their answers in Round 2 and 3) was not the reason for increased accuracy because **the decrease in truth-centered mean (absolute distance from the mean) in the social group was significantly larger than that in the control group**. Therefore, the change should be attributed to information from others. 

Another possible reason is that the increased accuracy for groups as a whole obscured the decreased accuracy at an individual level, for example, when the standard deviation of truth-centered mean in a group increased. Results showed that for social groups, the standard deviation of responses in Round 3 was significantly smaller than that in Round 1. This change did not occur in the control group, indicating that **similarity within social groups increased**. 

**Replication study design** has some differences from Experiment 1:

1. More controversial questions;
2. Participants were required to confirm their political preference before participating in the study;
3. The experiment interface included an image of an elephant and a donkey;
4. The answer from four other connected participants were accompanied by their political orientation;
5. Subjects knew that they were participating in a study related to "Politics Challenge". 

Items 2 - 5 were partisan primes intended to "enhance the effects of partisan bias on social information processing" (p. 4).

Results of the replication study: same as in Experiment 1, social learning increased participants' answer accuracy for both Democrats and Republicans. Participants within each group became more similar over time. 

So, 

>... social learning is robust to partisan priming for both group-level improvement and individual improvement. 

But how about the difference between Democrats and Republicans? The above results showed "within group" changes but not between group changes. Results showed that between-group similarity also increased for participants in the social condition (37% for Experiment 1 and 46% for the replication study), which means that polarization decreased. 

**To recap**: social information exchange within homogeneous networks helped people make more accurate estimates. Similarity within and between groups increased, indicating that people within social groups got similar, and that polarization diminished. And this result withstood partisan priming. 

My question: Will the result stay the same if information exchange is not confined to numeric estimates? Why don't we allow people to chat? Is it because of lack of technical support or that there is theoretical consideration against it?

Conclusion: Homogeneous networks do not necessarily lead to polarization. In fact, polarization is decreased and accuracy increased. 

Then why do we still have polarized public opinions? This is because popular social media are centralized networks, which make influencers able to exert disproportionate effects on other people in the network. 

Future directions: 
- Any other reasons why "echo chambers" and polarization coexist in reality? 
- Is it possible to replicate this study in real-life networks? For example, in Facebook or Twitter, where information exchange is not limited to numeric estimates?
- How could we eliminate, or at least reduce the effects of influencers in a network, if ever possible?

The experiment comparing the effects of two different network structures (clustered vs random) on the behavior spread was concluded in my [earlier post](/en/apad/#2020-09-12).

Another experiment involves an 11-week fitness initiative among 800 graduate students at Penn. The experiment consisted of four groups:
  1. Group 1: Control group. Participants were allowed to sign up for fitness classes through an online portal. 
  2. Group 2: Same as the control group, but participants were also divided into groups based on their similarities. On the online portal, class attendance of anonymized "health buddies" was displayed. Communication with each was not possible.
  3. Group 3: Access to the online portal + groups based on similarities + communication between health buddies
  4. Group 4: Conditions in Group 3 with scores of other groups displayed on the portal. 

In Group 1 and 2, individuals completing the most classes were promised to get monetary rewards. In Group 3 and 4, health buddy groups completing the most classes got the monetary rewards. 

Results: 1). Exercise rate in group 2 & 4 were much higher; 2). Group 3 did worse than the control group.

- Even without digital tools to communicate with each other, rebel activities became more widespread in Syria. This is surprising because without telecommunication, Syrian rebels lost long ties that bridge groups far away from each other. That is, they had to rely on face-to-face communication to coordinate. How did it happen? When you get to understand that the way behaviors spread is different from that information diffuses, the answer will become clearer.

- Information, messages, and ideas spread like an epidemic whereas human behaviors don't. Contagions can be classified into two types: simple and complex. A single contact can start a simple contagion, but won't do the same for complex contagions, which involve efforts and costs, and require confirmation or reinforcement from multiple sources. 

- Long ties are enough for simple contagions whereas complex contagions favor wide ties. How wide should a tie be for a behavior to spread varies. If reputation is at stake, the threshold will be higher. That's where complex contagions are very different from simple ones. In simple contagions, hubs get infected early and then it spreads the infections to many others. In a complex contagion, however, hubs usually have reputation at stake, so they are less, rather than more, likely to get infected.

>... allowing smokers and nonsmokers to exchange views while aware of each other's smoking status effectively reduced bias both in their evaluation of health risks, and in their beliefs about each other's capacity to accurately interpret scientific data about the health risks of tobacco use. 

An interesting finding in this study is that after interacting with each other in social networks (which was limited to numeric estimates in the study), smokers and nonsmokers did not differ significantly in their perceptions of smokers' ability to understand health information associated with smoking. This means that biases were reduced.

Study design: 

1,600 people were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. There are 10 independent trials in the experiment. Each trial involves 160 participants who were randomly assigned to the following three groups:

1. Control group: 40 smokers / 40 non-smokers, so 80 people in each trail. 

2. Anonymous network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were embedded into a random social network that is decentralized and anonymous.

3. Informative network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were put into a social network where they could see the usernames and the smoking status of their four network neighbors. 

Procedure: 

Participants were shown an [anti-smoking advertisement](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227813.g002) and were asked to estimate the health risk of smoking by answering this question: How many people (in millions) are predicted to die from tobacco use in developed countries, in 2030? 

Participants were incentivized by monetary reward awarded based on the accuracy of their final answer. Changes in answers' accuracy were measured by the difference between Round 1 and Round 3. 

- Round 1: Participants in all groups provided the answer independently. 

- Round 2: Group 1 revised their estimates with independent reflection. Group 2 were shown the average response of their contacts and then revised their estimates. Group 3 were also shown the average response by their four contacts. They were also shown the usernames and the smoking status of their contacts. 

- Round 3: Same as in Round 2. 

Results:

- In Round 1, both smokers and nonsmokers were equally inaccurate at estimating the health risk of smoking;
- No significant improvement in estimated accuracy in the control group. 
- The decrease in estimate error in group 2 was significantly greater than both smoker and nonsmokers in the control group;
- The decrease in estimated error in group 3 was significantly greater than group 2. Specifically, this decrease is ten times greater than both smoker and nonsmoker in the control group.

>The more equity in people's social networks, the less biased and more informed groups will become--even when those groups start off with highly partisan opinions. 

- We believe that if we are put in a group consisting of like-minded people (so called "echo chambers"), we probably won't develop ideas that are on the opposite side of the spectrum. However, two social media experiments found the opposite results. In a study, Democrats and Republicans were put into "echo chambers", and discussed polarizing issues such as gun control, unemployment rate, and immigration. Both groups ended up moving toward a more moderate view of the topics. 

- In another study, smokers and nonsmokers estimated the risks of cigarette smoking. After the study, both groups had a more accurate understanding of the topic, and a higher opinion of the other group.

- Social media of our time exacerbates rather than eradicates partisan bias, because it's centralized, rather than egalitarian. In a centralized network, influencers filter or even block information. For example, if an influencer spreads a piece of wrong information, it might end up becoming an entrenched false belief in the whole community, whereas in an egalitarian network, each person has an equal say, and ideas are weighed by its own quality rather than the influence of the people behind them.

  - Link sampling: similar to node sampling, select randomly a bunch of links, and nodes attached to these links are included in the sample;

>In a more complete analysis, the multiverse of data sets could be crossed with the multiverse of models to further reveal the multiverse of statistical results. 

This is so true. I have several thoughts about this point:

First, it shows how arbitrary the choices in data processing and model picking are, and therefore, how arbitrary the statistical results might be. When I was doing research on selfies, I also had the same feeling. When I was doing the content analysis study comparing the differences in White women's selfies on Twitter and Chinese women's selfies on Weibo, I had to made so many arbitrary choices: whether to drop an item from a construct, whether to combine items, should I use a *t* test or nonparametric test, etc. 

Second, doing multiverse analysis reporting is very methodologically challenging. I cannot imagine a Master student after attending one statistics class doing a project involving more than 200 choice combinations. 

Finally, scholars will find it more difficult to cite others' studies. Right now, it's fairly easy to cite because almost all research papers generate a **certain** result. With multiverse analysis, almost all studies will involve many **uncertainties**. This complicates how people interpret the statistical results. 

That said, statistics is about **uncertainties**. It's certainly good to show these **uncertainties**. I think the science community, and the public, should be accustomed to seeing **uncertainties** in statistical results in the coming years.

>A multiverse analysis is a way to avoid or at least reduce the problem of selective reporting by making the fragility or robustness of the results transparent, and it helps the identification of the most consequential choices. 

>Even when confronted with only one arbitrary data processing choice, researchers should be transparent about it and reveal the sensitivity of the result to this choice. 

>Increasing transparency in reporting through a multiverse analysis is valuable, regardless of the inferential framework (frequentist or Bayesian), and regardless of the specific way uncertainty is quantified: a *p* value, an effect size, a confidence (Cumming, 2013) or credibility (Kruschke, 2010) interval, or a Bayes Factor (Morey & Rouder, 2011).

The authors argued that "preregistration or blind analysis are not useful strategies for deflating the multiverse" (p. 709). I totally agree. I am not familiar with blind analysis, so I'll just talk about preregistration. As the authors noted, even if the study is preregistered, the result is still just one of the many possible choice combinations, albeit preregistered made. Therefore, the results of a preregistered study are still arbitrary, if the research involves arbitrary, or "whimsical" choices in data construction. 

The authors also talked about "model multiverse" at the end of the article.

Measure: a word's importance is measured by its frequency

Procedure:

2. Invite (and pay) native speakers to rate "how they felt in response to" (p.2390) each word on a 9-point Likert scale, with 1 representing the most negative or saddest, 5 neutral, and 9 the most positive or happiest. Each word receives 50 ratings, so there are 5 million human assessments in total.

Implication-2. Seeing fewer friends' positive posts led people to produce fewer positive words in their own posts, rather than the opposite. 

### Drawbacks
- The effect size is quite small. 

### Thought
As the *Editorial Expression of Concern and Correction* said, it is "a matter of concern" that what we see on social media is to such a large extent manipulated by tech giants. As the study found, the content we see has an effect on our well-being. Even if they don't, users should be able to know what they are going through, rather than becoming a subject in an experiment we are ignorant of.

### Measurements & Measures
- To test the hypotheses, how are negativity and positivity measured: The percentage of the words as either positive or negative produced by a person.
- A check before running the experiment: all four groups did not differ in emotional expression in the week prior to the experiment. 
- Why using a weighted linear regression:  It was described in the Study Design that the chance of a post being omitted is not fixed. However, an effect was found that when people see fewer posts (i.e., more omission), they in turn posted fewer words. Therefore, we need to account for this effect by assigning weights to people. Specifically, people having more omission were given a higher weight in the regression. See details on p. 8789. 

### Results
Both H1 and H2 were supported. As can be seen in [the figure](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/24/8788/F1.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1), when negativity is reduced, people generate more positive words and fewer negative words, compared to the control group. The opposite pattern occurs when positivity is reduced. It shows that **emotions expressed by our friends through online social networks influenced our own mood status**.  

Some implications:
1. Direct interactions were not necessary for emotional contagion. 

## 2020-10-27
Continue with Kramer et al. (2014)

### Study design
- Why are two (separate) control conditions needed? Because the percentage (46.8%) of posts containing at least one positive word is much larger than that (22.4%) of posts containing at least one negative word. Suppose that for a person, 10% of his **positive** News Feed is omitted, and there is only **one** control group, what should be the corresponding percentage of a person's **random** News Feed being omitted in this control group? I don't know. Why? For example, if there are three people in experiment A (positivity reduction group), and their content reduction rate is 12%, 13%, and 14% respectively. Accordingly, we assume that the content reduction rate in the control group should be 12% times 46.8%, 13% times 46.8%, and 14% times 46.8%.  **No**. Why? Because there is also experiment B, whose content reduction rate might be different than that of experiment A. **Therefore, each experiment needs a separate control condition**.

### Hypotheses
- H1: If emotions are contagious via pure exposure to verbal expressions, then compared to their control group, Group A will be less positive, reflected by posting fewer positive content than before) and Group B will be less negative, reflected by posting fewer negative content than before).

- H2: "Opposite emotion should be inversely affected" (p. 8789): Group A should express increased negativity, and Group B should express increased positivity. 

### Thoughts
- It's interesting that in people's own status updates during the experimental period, only 3.6% were positive and 1.6% negative. However, for posts in people's News Feed, 46.8% were positive and 22.4% were negative. Why was it that News Feed posts were so much more **emotional** than people's own status updates? Is it because Facebook's algorithms like to show more emotional content to its users? I guess so.

### Why is this study needed?
Correlational studies cannot answer this question since it cannot support causality. Controlled experiments can support causality, but they have these problems:
  1. Exposure is not equal to interaction. In a controlled experiment, mood change might come from interacting with a happy/sad person, rather than simply being exposed to that person's mood;
  2. Nonverbal cues are unavoidable in a controlled experiment, thus making it impossible for us to disentangle the effect of verbal cues.

Therefore, this study makes unique contributions to answering this question. 

### Study design
- Two parallel experiments: In experiment A, people see less positive emotional content whereas in experiment B, people see less negative emotional content. Both had a control condition, in which posts had an equal chance (see below) of being omitted, randomly (i.e., without considering their emotional valence).
  - How much less? Good question! According to the authors, "each emotional post had between a 10% to 90% change (based on their User ID) of being omitted from their News Feed ..."
  - Well, how do you categorize a post as positive or negative? Awesome question. If a post contains at least one positive word as defined by LIWC2007, then it is a **positive** post. The same is for negative posts.

### Key question
The key question this paper was trying to answer: does exposure to mood expressed in the News Feed on FB change the content people post (that reflects their mood changes)? Or in the authors' own words, "whether exposure to verbal affective expressions lead to similar verbal expressions, a form of emotional contagion."

### What problems can these measures cause:

- Authors might 1) complicate their methods section so that it's difficult for reviewers to fault it; 2) hide results that do not fit with their arguments; 3) split the findings into multiple papers even if one paper is enough to cover all the results; 4) compress the results to meet the requirements of top journals like *Nature* or *Science*; 5) hype their work.

  - I would add one: p-hacking.
  - The point that authors might complicate their methods section resonates with me strongly. After reading papers each day for over 6 weeks, I felt that the methods section of some papers is so dense and complicated that, if I were the reviewer, I didn't have that much time and effort to decode it! This, I think, is really a problem. As I mentioned multiple times, I feel the most ideal studies are those with **simple methodology** and yet **impactful results**. A perfect example is Professor Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz's masterpiece of [*Collective dynamics of 'small world' networks*](http://materias.df.uba.ar/dnla2019c1/files/2019/03/watts-collective_dynamics-nature_1998.pdf).

- Students have fewer opportunities to learn and fail. Since publication is so important, group leaders may end up writing students' work. 

  - I don't think this is true in social sciences. 

- Scientists spend a large portion of their time networking, which might bring them more co-authors, and leave a positive impression on journal editors. 

## 2020-10-23

Lawrence, P. A. (2007).

### How science and scientists are assessed today:

- Impact factors: Journals are evaluated based on their impact factors. Schools, departments and scientists "are assessed according to the impact factors of the journals they published in" (p. R583). 

- Number of citations: Scientists are evaluated according to the number of citations their publications receive.

### Why these measures are flawed:

- Impact factors (IFs): IFs reflect how many times, on average, each paper in a given journal gets cited in the two years following its publication. There are two problems with this measurement: 1) IF is about the journal, not about your paper. Even if your paper is flawed, or even wrong, it's still something you can boast, if it gets published in a top journal; 2) Important findings may receive very few citations within two years since its publication. 

- Number of citations: 1) People may cite papers simply because of convenience or visibility, not because of the significance of the studies. Many people don't even need to read the papers they cite. 2) Because citations are so important these days, there might be unethical behavior involved. For instance, gatecrashing names by providing a reagent or data without actually participating in the study, or simply by power or authority. 

### What problems can these measures cause:

- Paper chase: Scientists spend so much time on writing and reviewing for, and submitting to top journals that they don't have much time left on solving scientific problems;

- Scientists will dodge uncharted areas and unpopular topics which are too risky.

Main takeaways:

- In the most productive countries, papers with women in dominant author positions, i.e., sole author, first author, and last author, are cited less than those with men in the same positions;

- South America and Eastern Europe had greater gender parity in terms of proportion of authorships. 

- Disciplines dominated by women all have to do with "care", for example, nursing; speech, language, and hearing; education.

- Natural sciences and humanities are dominated by men. Social sciences had a higher proportion of female authors. 

- "Female collaborations are more domestically oriented than are the collaborations of males from the same country"  (p. 213)


My issue: How did the authors assign gender to each author? It seems to me a very daunting task, especially when the names are of a non-Western origin.

Major takeaway: Big data research can learn from, and collaborate with small data research, which offers data that is not contained in big data. 

I started to think about my selfie studies. Specifically, I looked at 1) whether there are cultural differences between Chinese women's selfies on China's Weibo, and White Women's selfies on Twitter. For example, is it true that Chinese women focus on their face whereas White women focus on their body in their selfies? Do Chinese women's selfies show more cuteness? 

I also looked at 2) whether there are gender differences between men's selfies and women's selfies. For example, do women show more self-touching in selfies? 

I used a small-data approach. Although I downloaded over 30,000 images from Twitter and 8,000 images from Weibo, I only selected 200 from each platform for analysis, simply because I didn't have that much manpower to analyze them all. 

Talking about big data and small data research, I think I can combine the two here. Human content analysis can offer some insights and then directions for big data research. After all, there are so many things to detect in a selfie: the gender of the person, his or her mood, surroundings, posture, facial expressions, etc. Deep learning algorithms need some directions so that they can give us the analysis we need.

Thoughts: Professor Granovetter is right in pointing out that data itself might not help us have a deeper understanding of our society. After all, his seminal paper on "weak ties" is based on theoretical thinking rather than data. 

What are most of the data in research papers used for? To test theories. But theories arise from thinking, not data. Data is limited. It's extremely difficult for most scholars to get high-quality large-scale data. That shouldn't become a barrier to theoretical advances. Scholars who cannot get access to quality data can focus on theoretical thinking.

1. Within the unstructured condition, there are more non-obese adopters than obese adopter, both in terms of number and percentage;

2. Across conditions: homophily boosted adoption among both the obese (*P* < 0.01) and the non-obese people (*P* < 0.05), using Mann-Whitney U test. 

We can see that homophily had a significant effect on adoption of healthy behaviors. However, is it because obese people are more likely to be **exposed** to the behavior, or those who are exposed are more likely to adopt these behaviors in a homophilous group?

3. It turns out that within both conditions, the relative percentage of the obese and the non-obese **did not** differ significantly. 

4. Across conditions: homophily boosted both the number and the fraction of the obese who were exposed to the behavior (*P* < 0.05), using Mann-Whitney U test. This happened despite that obese people initially had greater exposure in the unstructured networks. 

5. Did homophily affect the adoption rate among those exposed? The effect was significant among the exposed obese people (*P* < 0.01), using Mann-Whitney U test, but not among the exposed non-obese individuals. 

I like this study: simple, and impactful.

### Literature
Homophily is defined as "the tendency of social contacts to be similar to one another". Although research on diffusion, and that on social influence differ over the effects of homophily on behavior spreading at the dyadic level, both agree that homophily decreases adoption at the network level. This is because, obviously, the more homophilous one's network is, he is less likely to be exposed to individuals of a different characteristic. If you are a less healthy person, and you find yourself in a homophilous network, it's less likely for you to be aware of what those healthy guys are doing. 

### Purpose
To study the effect of homophily on the adoption of healthy behavior

### Design
710 participants are randomly put into two conditions: homophilous population condition, and unconstructed population condition. The homophilous population condition consists of people having similar individual characteristics (gender, age, and BMI) whereas people in the other condition are random and mixed. 

All networks in the study have the same size (= 72), clustering coefficient (= 0.4), and degree distribution (= 6). The only difference is the level of homophily. 

The study consisted of five trials, each having two social networks. All these trials ran at the same time, for seven weeks. The healthy behavior to be adopted is to write a diet diary online. 

The seed of the behavior in all networks is a "healthy" individual. At the start of Week 1, the author activated the seed nodes simultaneously. Once an individual signs up, their neighbors will be notified via email. 

### Results
Across all five trials, people in homophilous condition had a higher adoption rate than those in unconstructed condition. 

Comparing adoption among obese and nonobese individuals: Within homophilous condition, a greater percentage of obese individuals adopted the behavior than that of nonobese people. In unconstructed condition, both the number of and percentage of nonobese adopters were larger than obese adopters. In fact, there was **no** obese adopters in the unconstructed group at all. 

Comparing the two conditions: homophily increased the adoption among both the obese and nonobese people. 

However, from these results, we cannot say for sure that **homophily** is the reason. For example, it may be that in the homophilous condition, obese people have more neighbors who sign up and thus have more exposure. It may also be because that homophily increases the likelihood for people to sign up once they are exposed. Therefore, we need to compare 1.) **exposure**, and 2.) **the likelihood to adopt once exposed** in the two conditions. 

It showed that, **within each of the two conditions**, the percentage of exposed obese people (num. of exposed obese / total num. of obese ppl) and that of exposed nonobese people (num. of exposed nonobese / total num. of nonobese ppl) do not differ significantly. **Across conditions**, homophily significantly increased the percentage of exposed obese people. See Fig. 2D.

How about the likelihood? **within conditions**, the likelihood to adopt after exposure was much higher for the obesed than for the nonobesed. **Acorss conditions**, homophily significantly increased obese people's likelihood to adopt after exposure. 

Therefore, homophily increased obese people's **access** to, and the **likelihood** to adopt healthy behavior. 

>... low adoption levels of health innovations among less healthy individuals may be a function of social environment rather than a baseline reluctance for adoption.

>Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. — Chambliss, D. F. (p. 81)

### Excellence requires qualitative differentiation. 

Those who are more successful are doing **different** things, rather than **more of the same** things. Quantitative changes do bring success, but only **within** the world you are currently in. You cannot go to **another world** by doing more of what you have been doing. Those who are top performers are better to be seen as **different** rather than as **better**. 

### Talent is not the reason for excellence. 

1. First of all, factors other than talent predict success more precisely. 

2. Second, you cannot distinguish talent from its effects, i.e., you cannot realize there is talent until someone succeeds. 

3. Third, the amount of talent needed for excellence is surprisingly small. 

### Excellence is mundane.

1. Success is ordinary. Success is simply doing small tasks consistently and correctly.

**Note** : Below are the notes on 2020-10-04 

2. Motivation is also ordinary. Gold medalists did not think too far ahead. Instead, they focused on the most immediate goals, the so-called "small wins". For example, Steve Lundquist, who won two gold medals in swimming in the Los Angeles Olympics, set a goal that he would win every single swim in every single practice. **Small wins added up to excellence and success**. 

3. Don't take what you do as too important. You should maintain mundanity. If you are going to deliver a commencement speech in front of an audience of thousands, you should know that almost nobody cares about nor remembers what you have to say. When you are writing your doctoral thesis, you should also be aware that few people will read what you write.

  - For both males and females, the cumulative distribution of the number of partners in the previous 12 months almost perfectly followed a straight line, indicating scale-free power-law characteristics;

  - For both genders, the cumulative distribution of the total number of sexual partners in the entire lifetime followed a straight line only when `$k > 20$`. 

  - The network of sexual partners is a scale-free one, meaning that you cannot assume, for example, 90% of the individuals have 3 - 10 partners. This is simply because there is no inherent scale. It's a crazy world, literally. I cannot believe that there are people who have over 100, even 1000 partners in their lifetime. Isn't this a crazy world?

Other notes:

  - Thanks to this paper, I now know that for a power-law distribution to show a straight line, I need to use CDF (cumulative distribution function)

This paper is a little bit too technical for me, especially the second part that involves modeling. Also, I had difficulty understanding the conceptualization of "homogeneity" and "polarization".

Major takeaways from this paper:

  - Information on social media quickly reaches in 2 hours around 20% of the people it can reach in the end, and reaches in 5 hours around 40%. This is true for both science and rumors. 

  - Science news is usually quickly diffused. However, long-lasting interest doesn't correspond to the size of the interest. This means, even though people keep sharing it, not a lot of people will be interested in it. 

  - Conspiracy rumors diffused slowly and its cascade size is positively correlated with its lifetime. Meaning that the longer it lasts, the more people become interested in it.

The work is indeed significant. It compared the spreading of true and false news on Twitter and concluded that the false spread faster, deeper, and farther than the truth. False political news, in particular, is diffused especially broadly and deeply. 

- Was it because those who spread the false were more influential or active?

Not really. Those who spread false news had fewer followers, followed fewer people on Twitter, were less likely to be verified, and had been on Twitter for less time. 

- Was it because false news was more noval and users are more likely to retweet information with more novelty?

  - False rumors were indeed more novel than the truth;
  - False news was objectively more novel, but did users get it? 
    - Yes, replies to false news showed greater surprise and disgust, whereas the truth inspired more sadness and joy. 

- Was it because of selection bias? I mean, the tweets from the six organizations might not be representative of all tweets. 
  - The authors verified a second sample of Tweets, which were labeled by three undergraduate students as true, false, or mixed. Again, the results were the same. 

- Did false news spread faster, deeper, farther, and more broadly because of bot activities? I mean, was it because of  bots that crazily retweeted and replied to false news?
  - Two bot-detection algorithms were applied independently to detect and remove bots before data analysis. Results were the same. This has significant implications: that false news traveled faster and farther not because of bots, but because of humans. 

### I had several issues:
1. Bad data visualization

At first glance, data visualization in this article is good. However, most of the figures used only red and green and therefore are not friendly to color-blinded people.

2. Content analysis

They should report Krippendorff's alpha rather than an agreement of 90%, I believe.

- Increasing partisan preferences in the US created a context for fake news to attract huge audiences;

- We don't know the exact ratio of fake news against real news, and we don't know the medium-to-long-run effect of exposure to fake news on people's attitudes. 

- Bots on social media are hard to detect. Once a detecting technique is developed, bots will upgrade themselves. 

- Possible interventions:

  1. Encouraging people to use fact checking. However, we are not sure whether this is useful or not, partly due to people's confirmation bias and desirability bias. 
  2. Internet oligopolies should collaborate with academia to understand how pervasive fake news is. Also, these oligopolies' power should be contained by, for example, legal systems.

Lazer et al. (2020)

- Definition:
  - Computational social science: language, location, movement, networks, images, and video, using statistical models that capture multifarious dependencies.

- Problems
  1. Interdisciplinary research not encouraged enough, especially that involve cooperation between social and computer scientists, due to unfavorable policies at universities;
  2. Proprietary data unavailable to researchers.
  3. Available data is not intended for research and won't be shared with other researchers, which impedes reproducibility.
  4. Lack of regulatory guidance from university IRBs about collecting and analyzing sensitive data. 

- Recommendations
  1. Collaborate and negotiate with private companies for data;
  2. Build infrastructures that provide data as well as preserve participants' privacy;
  3. Develop new ethical guidelines;
  4. Reorganize universities so that 1) multi-disciplinary collaboration is professionally or financially rewarded, and 2) enforce ethical research
  5. Researchers make sure that they do public good.

2. Recapping Centola (2010):

- Contribution: An experimental design that ran contrary to previous findings regarding the strength of weak ties. 
- Conclusion: networks with local clustering are conducive to behavioral diffusion. 
- Method: An experiment with two groups. One group found themselves in a random network, and the other group in a clustered-lattice network. **Degree distribution of the two networks is identical**.
- Why could it be published on *Science*: Maybe the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of network topology on behavior spreading.
- My question: I didn't see many long ties in the "small-world network" in Figure 1.
- Improvements: I didn't know all of the statistical tests used in this paper. I know the Mann-Whitney U test but I don't know Kolmogorov-Smirnov. I am wondering whether the study could be conducted using Bayesian statistics.

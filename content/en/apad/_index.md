I was inspired by the story of [*This scientist read a paper every day for 899 days. Here‚Äôs what she learned*](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/this-scientist-read-research-academic-paper-every-day-what-she-learned), so I decided to try it myself: Dedicating half an hour everyday to reading papers. Let's see for how long I can keep doing it.

I skimmed through this paper. 

This paper talks about a sex worker rights organization in Canada which maintains a bad client list. One interesting point the authors point out is that technologies are not the **solution** to complex social justice problems; they only support, or aid, the efforts.

In *Proceedings of the 2018 Chi conference on human factors in computing systems* (pp. 1-14).

I skimmed through this paper. 

This paper is about how algorithmic decisions affect people's perceptions of justice. The study finds that people consider justice-related issues when they encounter decisions made by algorithms. The study also finds that explanations may or may not affect how people feel about the fairness of the decisions, depending on the scenarios. The authors conclude that there might be no best approach to explaining algorithmic decisions.

Google and its thousands of developers around the world have been using one single monolithic repository which contains one billion files and 35 million commits. Google used tools like Piper and CitC (Clinetns in the Cloud) to support using one monolithic repository. 

Using a monolithic repository has benefits such as encouraging collaboration and easier dependency management. The drawbacks are that it requires investment to support such a huge repository and the codebase might become too complicated. However, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and that's why Google is not interested in splitting the repository.

I skimmed through this thesis. 

Abhraneel's study tries to compare insights (operationalized as *recall* and *comprehension*) users obtain from visualizations with narratives and with interactivity (there are four conditions, see Fig. 1 on p.9). The results show narratives have weak effects and interactivity has barely any effects. The conclusion is that interactivity may not be a necessary component of information visualizations. This, however, by no means means that interactivity is always useless.

- The study finds that 73% of participants in CHI publications from 2016 to 2020 are from "WEIRD" (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries where 97% come from countries that satisfy all the five "WEIRD" variables. 

- Of 2,7688 papers, 2,611 had human participants. Of these 2,611, only 38.9% reported country origin of participants or allowed guessing based on the authors' country origin. 

- Around 70% of all the participants are university students or have a university degree.

- Over 80% of authors recruit participants "in their own backyards."

The paper first theorizes that as scientific fields get large, the top cited papers will only become more impactful, making new ideas hard to be found and cited. The authors then use data from Web of Science to test six predictions based on their theory. The data support the predictions.

The study uses three data sets, i.e., NIH grants applications, startups, and terrorist attacks to test a simple one-parameter model that predicts failure & success. The model works pretty well. Key findings:

  - Success is not due to chance. 
  - People who succeed do not necessarily try more times than their failed counterparts. 
  - Among successful people, there is significant improvement in the second attempt compared to the first one. This improvement is absent for the failed group. 
  - It is unnecessary to learn from all past failures.

Carsey, T. (2020). [*Tom‚Äôs Comments: Advice about Graduate School, Finding a Job, Reaching Tenure in Political Science and other Social Sciences, and All of the Steps in Between*](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/186/2020/09/Toms-Comments-Carsey-book-9-7-2020.pdf).

I skimmed through the whole book. Some suggestions I bore in mind:

  - Don't let graduate school kill your personal time. You need an adequate amount of sleep. You need to eat and drink well. You need to have a personal life. 
  - Especially in the first year, if you want to collaborate with two different professors, make sure to let them know. Otherwise, one of them will be surprised if you decline the opportunity to work with him/her. (p73)
  - Set aside time each day, at least each week, for writing. Do it even though you don't feel like doing it that day/week. 
  - Write one co-authored paper and one solo-authored paper each year in the first two years of your PhD. 
  - Mentorship is better than apprenticeship. The first means you work with more than one advisor to develop your own research agenda whereas the second means you work for only one advisor on his/her research project. 
  - Practice your research talk! You definitely need practice. 
  - *R* is good!

{{<block class="info" >}}
I disagree with Tom's suggestions about websites (p.70). Tom says it is not very useful if you have a professional website at the start of your PhD as you don't have much stuff to put on it. Rather, he suggests a website at the end of PhD when you are looking for a job. 

I highly disagree with it. In my opinion, **a homepage is much more than your CV**. Yes, you might not have papers to put on your homepage, but there are millions of other things you can put. Write blogs! Document your daily tangible progress! Publish your projects! Introduce yourself! These activities will (1) let you know what you lack, and (2) motivate you to make progress each and every day.

Again, your homepage is more than your CV!

The authors initiated a few neutral bots on Twitter, called "drifters". These drifters are the same except for the political alignment of the initial account they follow. The key findings of this paper:
  
  1. The information drifters receive is largely dependent on the initial accounts they follow. 
  2. Most drifters find themselves in echo chambers. Echo chambers of conservative accounts are especially dense. 
  3. Right-leaning drifters encounter more low-credibility information. 
  4. The type of content a drifter receives is not manipulated by the platform, i.e., Twitter. Rather, it was largely dependent on the political alignment of their friends.

This paper analyzed attention cycles for deceased public figures based on data collected from (1) news on the web and (2) Twitter mentions. The authors find that short-term boosts last for around 30 days within the death. On average, long-term attention boosts are largest for artists and smallest for leaders. It might be because artists have legacies that people can enjoy even after they die.

  - If you are too perfectionist, you'll probably never publish anything. 
  - Don't expect your PhD thesis to be perfect. If you do, you'll never be able to graduate. 

2. Stearns, S. [Modest Advice](https://stearnslab.yale.edu/modest-advice)

  - Prepare for the worst: your research might fail, you won't get along with your advisor. 
  - Your advisor doesn't have time to care about you. You have to figure out what to do on your own. 
  - If you don't understand someone else's work, then it's their fault. 
  - You have to figure out on your own why your work is important.
  - Never expect your thesis to be perfect. There is no perfect thesis. 
  - Be open to job opportunities outside of your PhD. This prevents you from losing your independence. If you know you have other options outside of your research, you are better off. 
  - Avoid taking lectures. 
     - "To learn to think, you need two things: large blocks of time, and as much one-on-one interaction as you can get with someone who thinks more clearly than you do."
  - "Write a proposal and get it criticized."
  - At least once a year, send to your advisor a 1-2 page file documenting the progress you've made to your program. Your advisor will appreciate that. 
  - Start publishing papers early on. 
  - Publish regularly but not too often. Uncited papers are a waste of time and energy.

1. Cirik, V. (2019). [*PhD 101*](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vcirik/blog/2019/phd-101/)

  - Research involves lots of uncertainty and failures. Be prepared. 
  - Don't equate your self-worth to research ideas you have. 
  - The narrative you see in papers sound like their ideas flow smoothly. In reality, it's never going to happen. There will be many trials and errors and many "dead ends". 
  - "Your relationship with your advisor is the single biggest factor on your happiness. Be **as transparent as possible.**"
  - Success is not equal to great personality. Don't be surprised if you know terrible things happening in your research community. 
  - PhD should definitely not become the whole of your life! You should have a life outside of your PhD!

2. Taylor, L. (2018). [Twenty things I wish I‚Äôd known when I started my PhD](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07332-x)

  - (About work-life balance & mental health)
  - Having a work-life balance by doing daily routines that work for you. Taking good care of yourself is key to your success. 
  - Have a life outside your work. PhD should not become your whole life. 
  - Socialize your other graduate students. 
  - Don't compare yourself with others. 

  - (About research)
  - Attend seminars and lab-group meetings. Things you'll hear might change your research trajectory completely. 
  - Back up. Back up. Back up. 
  - Write down everything. Don't count on your memory. 
  - You need *completed* work, not *perfect* work. 

  - (About relationship with advisor)
  - Discuss expectations with your supervisor. 
  - Be honest with your supervisor. 
  - Don't struggle alone. Ask help if you need.

The authors examined the relationship between (1) the degree of interdisciplinarity of research proposals and (2) the success rate of this proposal being approved of. 

The dataset consists of all proposals, both successful and unsuccessful, submitted to the Australian Research Council Discovery Programme from 2010 to 2014. 

Success rate is easy to calculate but "interdisciplinarity" of a proposal is not. Researchers used to measure "interdisciplinarity" by checking specific words like "interdisciplinary" or through bibliometric analysis. These two measures have many disadvantages. The authors here propose a new measure called interdisciplinary distance (IDD).

The results show that interdisciplinary proposals have lower success rates and this is not because universities with higher success rates submit more narrowly focused research proposals.

- Don't write papers just to be accepted by a conference. Write it like it will be a start of your whole new research path.

üëç Ruder S. (2020). [*10 Tips for Research and a PhD*](https://ruder.io/10-tips-for-research-and-a-phd/)

1. Read broadly. 

  - Look beyond your immediate interest. Papers that connect different topics and even different fields are insightful. 
  - It's better to read 10 papers superficially than to read one paper in depth. With a paper management system, you can always go back and read more deeply. 

2. Work on two things. 
   - If you only have one project in hand, then : 1) when the project fails, you lose motivation; 2) when the project comes to a standstill, you have no choice but to keep grinding. In comparison, if you have two projects, you can work on the other one if one project is stagnant, which gives you a rest and maybe a new perspective. 

   - If the two projects are in different fields, then it's better to focus on one project a day. 

3. Be ambitious. 

   When you have two projects going on, one can be a safe one and you can take risks with the other one. The risky one might have more impact if it succeeds. Work on something that excites you. Challenge the status quo. 

4. Collaborate. 

   - If you collaborate with others remotely, it's important to "communicate clearly and to set expectations". 

   - Be open in terms of collaboration. Work with something different than your supervisor. Collaborate with people from a different university than your own. 

5. Be proactive. 

   Seek out collaborations, meetings, and advice actively. Talk with people.

6. Write a blog. 

   Writing a blog helps you develop your communication skills.

7. Keep a source of positive energy. 

   - Work on things that excite you. If you cannot decide things to work on, try to find an angle that excites you. 

   - Establish a support network that you can count on. Surround yourself with positive people. 

   - Find something that you can fall back on when things don't go well: exercise, a side project, meditation, blogging, to name just a few. Always remember that your well-being is the single most important thing. 

8. Play to your strengths. 

   This section is very inspiring for me personally. I come from a non-CS background and should use this as a strength. A different perspective on and/or approach towards problems is my strength. 

9. Intern or visit a university. 

   - If you are deciding between the industry and academia, an internship or a research visit can give you insights. 

   - Working with a mentor different from your advisor can help you grow. 

10. Play the long game. 

   Be nice üòé.

üëç Liu, L., Wang, Y., Sinatra, R., Giles, C. L., Song, C., & Wang, D. (2018). [Hot streaks in artistic, cultural, and scientific careers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0315-8). *Nature, 559*(7714), 396-399.

This paper is significant because it reconciles two opposing models of individuals' career productivity. The first model is the "Matthew effect" which believes that there is a unique period when a person performs consistently better than in other periods. The second model argues that the best work is purely random and is driven by high productivity. 

The hot-streak model proposed by this paper argues that peak-performance period occurs randomly in a person's career, but high-impact work is more likely to occur during this hot-streak period. 

The study begins by investigating the probability of each of the three most impactful work (`$N*$`, `$N**$`, and `$N***$`) by an artist, film director, and a scientist and finds that each of the three works by an individual occurs randomly. But when the authors looked at the distance between individuals' most impactful work, they found that high-impact work tends to occur together. That is to say, there is a temporal correlation between highly impactful work for an individual. 

Some other key findings in this paper:

1. All three careers, i.e., artists, directors, and scientists have peak-performance periods, but the hot-streak pattern varies across careers. See Figure 2 for details. 

2. Hot streaks rarely happen more than once. 

3. For the three careers considered in this paper, a hot streak usually lasts 3-6 years.

4. People are not more productive during a hot streak period.

- Social scientists focus on explanations that are often for causal relationships derived from theories. Computer scientists, on the other hand, emphasize predictions. As long as a model improves predictions, computer scientists is Okay with the model being super complex. 

 - What NHST, a method applied widely in social science research, does is that it tests whether the hypothesized effect derived from theories is not zero. If it is not zero, then researchers conclude these observations are not in conflict with the theory, so the theory can continue to be used as an explanatory tool. 

 However, NHST has the following flaws:

   - NHST does not test directly the outcome of interest, nor the magnitude of effect. It only looks at whether the hypothesized effect based on a theory is non-zero. 

   - In reality, many effects are non-zero. Therefore, statements that a theory cannot be ruled out by data are not valid as they appear. 

- Computer scientists use models to predict. It should be noted that the value of a model does not only depend on its absolute performance, but also its comparison with a baseline. For example, search data is highly correlated with flu numbers two weeks later, which is quite impressive. But it turns out that the same correlation can be found between CDC case numbers in previous weeks, and case numbers in future weeks.

This paper analyzed audiences' log data from three interactive visualizations authored by Idyll, a markup language to create interactive content. 

- My main takeaways from this papers are:

  - People usually spend around 1-2 minutes on a visualization. 

  - If some contents are hidden behind a click, around half of the people will not click and see it. Maybe they don't notice it or they are satisfied with high level information enough to skip details. 

  - Many people will quickly skim through all the content before they dive into details (if they ever do so).

- How I can further this work:

  1. The function of accessing users' log data is restricted to visualizations made by the Idyll language. However, most interactive visualizations available online might be created by other languages. This means we cannot use this feature to study interactive visualizations in the wild. 

  2. I am thinking of a study where I ask participants to interact with many interactive visualizations and look at what features of visualizations (1) make people spend more time and (2) lead to better recall.

I skimmed through this paper. The authors use machine learning theories to model how people form beliefs. This approach is different from the Bayesian one. A Bayesian model of human learning posits that people have a prior and update this distribution based on new data. An ML approach, on the other hand, allows people to discard one prior for another when the old one fails to explain the data.

Instrumental rationale of diversity: diversity brings educational benefits. 

Moral rationale: diversity involves intrinsic values such as justice. 

White participants (students & caregivers) prefer and expect more positive outcomes at instrumentally motivated universities compared to moral motivated ones. Black participants prefer and expect the opposite. University admission officers are aware of, and share these preference and expectation differences.

Both texts from the official websites of universities and admission officers show that universities use instrumental rationales to a greater extent than moral ones. 

Regression models show that when texts from official websites show low morality, high instrumentality correlates with worse graduation rates for Black students. 

The results of this study show that the common practice of diversity among universities favor White Americans rather than racial minorities.

They find that when people are experiencing stress, their blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) will be significantly higher than their baseline level. Resources people have to cope with stresses, such as financial, and interpersonal networks, have a role here as well. The more resources people have, the lower their blood pressure will be when experiencing stress.

The authors find that providing additional training on algebra for incoming 9th graders with median skills in algebra, most of whom were minorities from low-income families, increased their life chances. For example, those who received double-dose on algebra stayed longer in college and were more likely to obtain college degrees. 

The key to the success of this intervention is that (1) the schools strictly adhere to the policy, and (2) schools assign median-skills students to classes with similar or higher, but not lower, math skills.

Those who are at a health and social disadvantage tend to have both parents and children who are high-need users of health and social sectors. This means the disadvantage can be transmitted from the past generation and to the next generation. 

Education disrupts the transmission from the previous generation and to the next generation. For people in the same generation, siblings with higher education have reduced risks for these disadvantages.

I understand why the hedge fund manager (end of p. 18) believes he deserves the money: those who excel get more money. This idea makes sense when you only look at the "market" you are in. But when you look at the world from above, you will realize that the reason why you can be successful and earn so much money is not because you are hardworking (there are millions of people who are more hardworking than you are but failed); It's because many others have helped you in one way or another and you are simply lucky. The moment you look down upon a poor man as being not hard working enough, you misunderstand how the world works.

The authors analyzed 14 million books (Google Books) in English (US), German, and Spanish in 125 years (1855-2019) based on the prevalence of labeled cognitive distortion schemata (CDS) language patterns. As Fig. 2 shows, the prevalence of CDS language markers is much higher nowadays than 100 years ago. The increase starting from 2007/2008 is very obvious. 

I am wondering whether the results are due to artifacts. In the past, the elite few were the sources of the authors. Nowadays, it's becoming more common for ordinary people to publish. Therefore, books in the past were not good indicators of the general public. That said, this is a very impressive study. Since the data is freely available online for everyone, I can no longer use "lack of data" as an excuse for not being able to publish high quality research.

  3. Reporting exclusively *p*-value inequalities (such as *p* < 0.01) has been decreasing modestly.

The analysis is based on data extracted from historical records of ancient Korea.

- Countries experiencing extreme weather events are more likely to suffer from, rather than initiating, military attacks. This means that attacks during extreme weather events are more likely to be *opportunistic* rather than *desperate*. 

- Food shortage mediates the relationship between extreme weather and being invaded. That is to say, extreme weather events have a significant effect on food insecurity which predicts invasion of a country. 

- The possibility of successfully deterring an attack drops when the country being invaded is experiencing extreme weather events. The extent of this drop varies from country to country, though.

Skipper, C. (2018). [*How to Kick Your Bad Habits (And Why That's More Important Than You Think)*](https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-break-bad-habits).

- In the world we live now, people focus on results. Social media exacerbates the problem because people only share with others their results and highlights in life. 

- A ture long-term thinking does not involve goals. Goals are about winning an instance of a game whereas systems are about "continuing to play the game."

- You should view a habit you want to develop as a lifestyle (since you'll have to do it forever) rather than a finish line to cross. 

- For habits you wish to get better at, you need a process of reflection and review. Document your efforts and the results. 

- To break a bad habit, you can either decrease your exposure to it or increase the difficulty to access it. 

- In terms of a habit, even if you cannot do the whole thing, you should make a slight improvement. Throw away the 'all-or-nothing' mentality. If you act upon a habit until you feel it can transform your life altogether, you'll end up achieving nothing. 

- **Find out the key moments in your day that determine how you spend the next one or two hours. Work backwards from those moments and try to figure out what was the trigger events that caused these moments.** 

- "Prune away the good things to get to the great things". This means to find out what is most important for you.

### Research questions:

1. Do personality traits change interventions work compared to the control group?

2. Do personality traits change in the desired direction?

3. Do other people detect these changes?

4. Can the changes be maintained?

### Results

1. Participants in the intervention group show significantly greater changes compared to the control group. 

2. In the intervention group, participants who want to increase or decrease a trait see their desired changes. These changes are on the traits they want to change. 

3. Observers only see increases for participants who want to increase a trait, but do not see decreases for those who want to decrease a trait. Further analysis shows that observers only see a significant increase in conscientiousness.

4. When traits are measured by self-reports, they do not change 3 months after the end of the intervention among participants who want an increase on a trait whereas they witness another decrease among participants who want a decrease on a trait. Further analysis shows that participants who want a decrease in neuroticism showed another significant decrease after the end of the intervention whereas participants who want a decrease in openness showed a significant increase in openness. 

   When traits are gauged by observers, they increase 3 months after the end of the intervention among participants who want an increase on a trait. Traits are maintained for participants who want a decrease. Further analysis shows that only participants who want an increase in openness show a significant increase in openness after the end of the intervention. All other participants do not show significant changes. 

### Discussions

People in the control group also have motives to change their personality traits. They do not show significant changes because they do not receive treatment. This means that only having motives to change personalities do not necessarily lead to changes.

>We can't seamlessly switch from doing one thing to doing another thing. Our mind isn't capable of that. 

>Notice what you pay attention to when you're low on energy. So when you're kind of burnt out a little bit, what apps do you fire up? What websites do you visit mindlessly, out of habit, that just stimulate you and prevent you from really resting? [Knowing those is] a way by which we can shut off autopilot. 

>When we say we don't have time for something, we're really just saying that something's not important to us. You hear people say, "I don't have time to read this book." But then they have time to check email, or read the news, or go on social media for a few hours. What we really mean when we say we don't have time for something is that we don't have the attention or patience for it. You have time for everything. It's just that you choose to do other things.

BUt now, there's so much pressure in modern society to perform and to be productive, to be efficient, that we don't have this time to recharge. We tend to pathologize these kinds of sadness or losses of energy. 

>Well, now we've actually had these therapies for 100 years and the world is just getting worse. How could that be? The answer is that all the sensitive, intelligent, resourceful people that should be out changing the world, they're actually just sitting in the therapy room trying to realize themselves or improving themselves. 

>[But] staying with the image of the airplane, I would say the problem is nowadays that the plane is coming down, the pressure in the air cabin is falling, and the masks are coming down. People are putting on the masks, helping themselves, and breathing frantically into these masks. Then we call it mindfulness or therapy or self-help or whatever. And no one really gets up from the chair and tries to see what is going on with this aircraft. The pilots have passed out and the plane will actually crash because no one takes an interest in the whole structure. They only sit in their seat and breathe into their own masks. We actually need people who are brave enough to stop breathing into the mask and take an interest in the overarching structure.

That's a really powerful metaphor!

Mean years of schooling (MYS) alone is not sufficient to indicate a person's true skills. The authors proposed a way to measure the quality of human capital. The authors employed the literacy skills dataset for countries across the globe to compute SLAMYS: skills in literacy adjusted mean years of schooling. Figure 3 shows that even though MYS indicates that the gap between the high-performing and low-performing countries is narrowing, the SLAMYS scores show that this gap is increasing fast. According to SLAMYS scores, the gap between countries above 3rd quartile and below 1st quartile is equivalent to ten years of schooling.

During the pandemic, DataCamp saw a 38% increase in the number of new users, and a 6% increase in exercise time by existing users. 

Figure 2A shows that a slightly higher proportion of new registration comes from high-income and high-college neighborhoods. Figure 2B shows that people in low-income and low-college communities experience a larger increase in their time spent on DataCamp. 

This study indicates that when people have more free time, they can use that time for upskilling, and this change is relatively consistent across regions with varying income, racial and educational compositions. This means that to alleviate the skill gaps in the US workforce, it's a good idea to give employees more free time so that people can upskill.

Finished [Seraj et al. (2021)](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/7/e2017154118)

The authors analyzed posts in r/BreakUps subreddit, and found that a month before, during, and three months after the breakup, people's analytical thinking drops (meaning their thoughts are less structured and logical) whereas cognitive processing increases (meaning that they are trying to understand the situation). Sample markers of cognitive processing (a.k.a, working through) include "because", "understand", "should'', etc. Also evident is that people are using more I-words and We-words. 

The authors did not stop here and asked additional two questions: 1. Does writing a lot about the breakup help people recover? 2. How to compare these changes with language changes among people going through other kinds of emotional upheavals?

Most people (84%) spend 1-4 days talking about their breakups, whereas 16% of people spend 5 or more days. Both the short-term and long-term users have similar language patterns (analytical thinking, cognitive processing, I-words, and We-words) during the months leading up to the breakup. However, it takes long-term users twice as much time as short-term users to return to the baseline value of their language patterns. However, it's impossible to establish a causal relationship. It might be that those who spend more time writing about their breakups experience a more difficult time and thus find it hard to adjust. 

The changes in language patterns among people who experience divorce in r/Divorce mimic those of r/BreakUps users. But r/offmychest users have somewhat different patterns since they post various kinds of emotional upheavals.

In this Viewpoint, Cal Newport argues that it's better to see the impact of technologies from a determinist viewpoint, that new technologies drive human behaviors into unplanned directions. He takes emails invented by IBM and the "Like" button by a Facebook engineer as examples. Emails were meant to facilitate internal communication within IBM. However, people began sending much more messages the moment they started emailing. The "Like" button, designed to replace some approving comments such as "nice!" and "great!", made people check their Facebook account constantly for rewards. 

The author later coins the term *complex side effects*, negative impacts that new technologies may have that are not expected when the technologies were invented. Cal Newport argues that engineers should include the evaluation of complex side effects in their "iterative engineering process".

1. When you have an idea, start writing the paper now! Don't wait until your research is finished. No! "Writing papers is a primary mechanism for **doing** research, not just for **reporting** it".

2. The primary goal of your research is to communicate a "useful and re-usable idea". This idea should be "clear" and "sharp". After reading your paper, the readers should be 100% sure what THIS idea is. Distill your paper into one single sentence which conveys the main idea, and make this idea explicit: "The main idea of this paper is ...", "In this section we present the main contributions of this paper." Many papers have great ideas but they didn't "distill what they are".

  - Of course, you need to convey a single idea but don't have the pressure to only present a fantastic idea. Rather, you should "write a paper, and give a talk, about any idea, no matter how insignificant it may seem to you".

{{<block class="tip">}}
Your readers should be able to sum up your paper with one single sentence: This paper finds that... 
{{<end>}}

3. The narrative flow: Here is a problem -> It's an interesting but unsolved problem -> Here is my idea (to solve it) -> My idea works (with details and data) -> Here is how my idea compares to others' approaches.

  - Abstract (4 sentences)
  - Introduction (1 page)
  - The problem (1 page)
  - My idea (2 pages)
  - The details (5 pages)
  - Related work (1-2 pages)
  - Conclusions and future work (0.5 page)

4. The introduction does two things in one page only: (1) "Describe the problem", and (2) "State your contributions". When introducing the problem, use an example! When stating your contributions, try using bullet points to make the structure clearer. 

  - Do not write this in your introduction: "The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2...." Instead, your introduction is supposed to survey the whole paper. 

5. Between *Introduction* and *The problem*, don't insert *Related work (Literature review)*. Instead, put it between *The deatils* and *Conclusions and future work*. 

6. When presenting your idea, use simple examples that even a novice can understand. 

7. Readers & Reviewers

  - When your draft is done, you can send it to the author of the paper on which your research is based. Ask them "could you help me ensure that I describe your work fairly?". Since they are interested in this, they most often will reply. 

  - Be grateful for every single word your reviewers put in the review. Treat criticism as positive suggestions that can help make your work clearer. Even if the criticism is wrong and it turns out the reviewer did not spend time and effort on understanding your (completed) work, try simplifying it!

### General advice

- Submit by the deadline
- Follow instructions by the organizer closely
- Spell check
- Use strong visual structure in your paper: sections and subsections, bullet points
- Use nice pictures/diagrams
- Use simple words and phrases

üëçüëç Eisner, J. (2010). [Write the Paper First](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/write-the-paper-first.html).

This article is very encouraging and eye-opening for me!

The key idea of this post is that if you are planning to submit a paper to a conference, you need to write your paper right now! It's totally Okay, and even expected, if you haven't run the experiment and don't have any tangible results. You can put empty tables and figures in the Results section. **The main goal of the experiments is to allow you to put numbers in those empty tables/figures**. Remember, you should never postpone writing until your experiment is finished.

### Why?

1. Clear writing triumphs over your experimental results in terms of (1) odds of acceptance and (2) likelihood of being cited. 

2. If you complete the writing before you do the experiment, you can send it to your advisor or colleagues who can give you suggestions. If they think the idea you want to convey sucks, you don't need to waste your time actually doing the experiment. And your writing isn't a waste of time since you may find the idea applicable elsewhere. 

### What should you do?

Write the *Introduction*, where you need to present a big picture and sell your idea. Then, the *lit review*. Don't do a lit review before writing your own ideas. This is because after writing your own ideas, you can see them from a different perspective when writing the lit review. Then write the *methods*/*experimental* and even the *results* section. (The author didn't mention the *results* section. I think it is possible, though.)

People in Western individualistic societies value passion and excitement whereas East Asian collectivistic societies value calm and balance. This is why you see so many faces with big toothy smiles in Western societies but less frequently see them in East Asian countries and regions.

The study finds that among over 1 million 15-year old students around the globe, passion predicts academic achievement, i.e., scores in science (2015), math (2012), and reading (2009), more strongly in individualistic societies than in collectivistic ones. The result remains the same after controlling for GDP per capita. Other cultural differences than individualism-collectivism are not robust predictors of the relationship between passion and academic achievement. Note that it doesn't mean passion is unimportant in collectivistic societies; Passion is still a significant predictor of academic achievement in these societies. 

Support from parents predicted academic achievements more strongly in collectivistic societies than in individualistic ones.

The authors of this opinion piece argue that partnerships between humanitarian and development organizations (HDOs) such as ICRC, UNICEF, and WHO, and academics may fail. 

1. Funding and human resources may be limited. 
  - HDOs think that universities may have their own funding for experimental studies. However, truly experimental work is not sufficient to produce products that satisfy HDOs' needs as many products are expected to be working in very harsh conditions. 
  - Researchers in universities may see HDOs as an external funding source. However, HDO funds need detailed reporting to donors. Since research needs lots of money and may not produce any tangible results at all, it's very difficult for HDO to spend many financial resources on R&D. 
  - HDO may face a lack of human resources committed to the partnerships. There is lots of paperwork to do and HDO staff already have their tasks. They may not have time to write project plans and funding reports. 

2. Deployment and sustainability
  - Products, for example, medical equipment, need training, maintenance, and upgrade services. However, the company that is tasked with producing the equipment has little interest in these. Training and maintenance needs money which normally comes from selling loads of these products. However, HDO only needs a limited number of them. This won't create profits for the company. 

  - Once the partnership produces a publication, researchers are no longer interested in it. They have to move on to other projects that produce papers. 

3. Roles, responsibilities and expectations
  - When HDOs find an interesting publication, they may invest thousands of dollars to implement it. However, there might exist a huge gap between academic publication to implementation. HDOs may waste lots of money. 

  - HDOs have a longstanding distrust in commercial sectors and believe academia is neutral. This is wrong. Universities nowadays are very commercialized. HDOs should update their view on companies and universities.

The authors of this opinion argued that a better solution to the replicability crisis in science is to shift the focus from replicating single studies to designing and conducting progressive sequences of studies that accumulate evidence on a certain topic. Researchers should be encouraged to participate in these progressive sequences of studies. Administrations of universities should shift the reward system from emphasizing single studies to these sequences of studies. Funding agencies such as NSF should do the same.

Finished Borkin et al. (2015)

The authors web scripped close to 5,700 visualizations, among which there are 2,070 single visualizations. Then then annotated these visualizations based on their taxonomy for static visualizations (See 3 Visualization Taxonomy). They also tagged the source of each visualization, i.e., infographics, scientific publication, news, and government/world organizations. 

They selected a subset of 410 visualizations and presented them to participants on Amazon MTurk. Each visualization **is treated as an image** and is presented for only 1 second. Participants press the key if they see a visualization for the second time. Therefore, this study looks at which types of visualizations as images are more memorable. 

### Results

- If a visualization is more memorable. It is more memorable for most people. That is to say, "[T]he memorability of a visualization is a consistent measure across participants."

- The following attributes in visualizations contribute to memorability: having pictograms, colorful, chart junk, high visual densities. 

- Unique types of visualizations, such as diagrams, networks, and trees are more memorable than common types such as bar, line, and pie charts. 

- Infographic visualizations are the most memorable, followed by visualizations from scientific publications, news, and government. Scientific visualizations are memorable possibly because they contain more diagrams. 

### Further thoughts

1. How about interactive visualizations? What characteristics make interactive visualizations more memorable?

2. How about testing memorability a week after the experiment as well?

This work is exciting. 

The authors used the same dataset as in *What makes a visualization memorable?*. 393 single visualizations are selected, among which 100 are randomly chosen to be shown to participants in the **Encoding Phase**. Participants spent 10s on each visualization in this Phase. Then, in **Recognition Phase**participants are shown 200 visualizations (100 are shown before, the other 100 are filler visualizations). The duration of each visualization is 2 seconds. Participants press keys to indicate whether they have seen each visualization in the previous Phase. Lastly, in the **Recall Phase**, each participant is shown the visualizations they managed to recognize in the Recognition Phase. These visualizations are artificially blurred by the authors. Participants are asked to input any information they remember of each visualization in an empty box right next to the visualization. 

Here are what the authors find:

- If a visualization is memorable "at a glance" (where people see it for only 1 second), it is also more likely to be memorable if people see it for 10 seconds. 

- "Human recognizable objects" help make visualizations recognizable. 

- Visualizations that are the most recognizable after 1 second exposure are likely to get descriptions of the highest quality after 10-second exposure. 

- A good title helps people recall the visualization. 

- Pictograms do not hinder recall. 

- Data and message redundancy help people recognize and recall the visualization.

### How to interact with your advisor

- The fact that you like a professor's research doesn't necessarily mean that you will be comfortable working together. 

- Your advisor is your boss. When you want you to do something, do it. 

- It's better to meet your advisor regularly, for example, weekly. Remember to make an agenda for each meeting. Bring your results to the meeting. Start each meeting with the summary of points in the last meeting.

### Be productive

- To be productive, creative, and independent. 

>[T]he purpose of graduate school is research, not taking classes. Although taking classes is part of graduate school, when it comes to success, it's all about research. Do well enough in your classes but focus on publishing high quality research papers. 

- "Talk to other students". 

- Communicate with your advisor regarding your preferences of working. 

- It's better to work in the lab for at least 20 hours each week. If you cannot focus on your studies/research in the lab, talk to your advisor and find a solution. 

- Prioritize.

- If you aren't healthy or happy, you won't be productive in research. 

### Research

#### Reading papers

- Read, read, read. "Read multiple papers a week". If you are unsure of what to read, consult your advisor. 

- Take notes of every paper you read. Some need detailed notes, whereas others need simple notes. 

- When it comes to important papers in your field, read deeply. Understand them thoroughly. 

#### Research ideas

- When choosing a research topic, you need to know the literature, and the "online dialogue" within your field. 

>Try to focus on big problems rather than making incremental improvements to previous work. 

>You will be judged on what you publish, not how long it took you to come up with the idea. 

- Only work on solutions to problems that **do** exist. 

#### Results

Know why your method does not get 100% accuracy on your data. This will help you improve upon your work. 

#### Publishing

- Organize your folders, codes, texts, etc. IMMEDIATELY after a paper submission. If you don't do it then, you won't do it later either. 

- Release your codes and data after your submission/publication. 

### Talks

- Practice. Practice a lot for a talk. 

- Seek feedback/suggestions from friends/colleagues. 

- Focus on content, not form. 

- Pay attention to Timing. 

### Professional development

1. Do internships, either early one or later when you have special skill sets. It doesn't hurt to have more than one internship. 

2. Start reviewing papers in your field early on. 

3. Give talks so that others know about you and your work. Being well-known will help you find a job later. 

### Progressing in PhD

- Year 1 - Year 2/3: Take classes, find an advisor, read tons of papers, observe how others do research, finish a project with results (not necessarily a publication).

- Year 3 - Year 4/5: Choose a research area, and publish papers in that area. 

- Year 5/6: Write your thesis

### Networking

Making tutorials will help people know your name. Attend conferences frequently and introduce yourself. 

### Jobs

Know what makes you happy (industry, government, starting a company, teaching, research, eetc) and do it after your PhD.

- A thesis proposal is a contract. Try to make the contract as specific as possible. Remember to put in your proposal some milestones (e.g., completing literature review, complete surveys, submit for publication, etc.), dates and the completion criteria of these milestones. "The proposal needs to create the impression that failure is *unlikely*". 

>Good proposals give the impression that between one-third and two-thirds of the work remains to be completed. 

- A proposal should be around 15 pages, not longer. Limit the presentation time to 30-45 minutes.

Overview: The study finds that a redundant encoding (here, value represented with shades of gray) has no benefits nor harm for (1) accuracy and (2) speed of judgement of graphs encoded with single primary encodings (position, angle, area, length).

### Study aims
The study examines whether a redundant encoding, in this case, values represented by shades of gray, will boost or harm **accuracy** and **speed** of understanding graphs encoded with various primary encodings (position, length, angle, and area). 

The study also examines whether the additive benefit of value, if any, to accurate encodings (e.g., position) will be greater than to less accurate encodings (e.g., area).

### Results
1. Position is the most accurate encoding, followed by angle, area, and length. 
2. The redundant encodings do not have any effects on the understanding of graphs encoded with the four primary encodings. The hierarchy of accuracy with redundant encodings is the same as that with single primary encodings. 
3. Participants completed tasks on graphs with redundant encodings in the same amount of time as participants completing tasks on graphs with single primary encodings. 

### Discussions
1. Readers might have filtered out the redundant encoding, i.e., values represented with shades of gray, and focused on primary encodings of the graph. 
2. An open question: If we pair visual variables that have similar accuracy properties, for example, angle & area, will we see a boost or drop in accuracy of understanding & completing time?

### Classes

Everyone will care about your research and what contributions you made. 

>[Classes] should come second to your research, your data, your questions. 

>The PhD program is all about learning new things, but as your research problems lead you there. 

>You might seek out a class to help you master something you know you need in research. But let the research drive that exploration and those decisions.

Key points in this essay:

- Duckworth promises in her book more than what "grit" can deliver. 

- Grit is nothing more than other personality traits, such as industriousness. 

- Grit matters but only in certain situations in life, not all of them. There is a "restriction of range". Some papers concluded that grit does not predict academic success, in New England or in Austria. 

- Grit makes some differences in life, but certainly not "all the difference in the world".

- Grit is perhaps just a rebranding, rather than producing something new. 

- It might be impossible to change your personality. 

- Being high in grit might be harmful. For example, you might hurt yourself physically if you are too focused on a goal. 

Some quotes in this essay:

>And like other self-help authors, she pulls a sleight of hand by which even widely held assumptions end up looking like discoveries. It's as important to work hard, the book contents, as it is to be a natural talent. Who would disagree with that?

>For most people, life may be less like a marathon than a series of sprints, interspersed with periods of rest and hours upon hours spent browsing the internet. 

>It's one thing to argue that grit matters more than talent or‚Äî‚Äîmore accurately‚Äî‚Äîthat your personality helps determine your success. Duckworth goes much further, asserting that you can change your personality and learn to "grow your grit."

>It could be that having too much strength of purpose is worse than having not enough.

For Americans with medical training, these two figures are 11.55% and 50%, respectively. This is surprisingly high, given that they have received formal medical training. 

- Participants in Study 2 (i.e., those who received medical training) who endorse more false beliefs report that a Black person feels less pain. These participants are also less accurate in their treatment recommendations for black targets.

- Fig. 2 shows that Black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than are white men. This number is 1.2-1.7 for American Indian/Alaska Native men, 1.3-1.4 for Latino men, and 0.5 for Asian/Pacific Islander men. 

- 1 in 1000 black men and boys will be killed by police over their lifetime. This is a nontrivial death risk. 

- 1.6% of deaths involving black men between 20 and 24 years old are caused by police use of force.

- Fig. 2 showed that when the number of children is fewer than two, then the more education people receive, the more satisfied they are with their marriage. The results are the opposite when the number of children exceeds two. **Caution**: I do not know whether these differences are significant. 

- Wealth is not a significant moderator: rich or poor, you'll be less satisfied with the marriage if you have more children.

{{<end>}}

- Replication crisis, especially in social and biomedical sciences
- Preregistration may not be a panacea as it discourages exploratory analyses. 
- Quotation errors: 1/5 to 1/10 scientists interpreted others' work inaccurately when citing the work
- Many retracted papers are still cited after retraction. 
- Predatory publishers are a real problem. Chances are authors are aware that the publishers are not legitimate but they go ahead anyway due to pressure to publish a lot. Also, if malicious people publish misleading work intentionally, the public will be misinformed and gradually have a lower trust in science overall. 
- arXiv papers that later published in prestigious venues attracted more citations than those found their places in less well-known journals. This indicates journals are a good gatekeeper. However, there is another side of the story: highly cited arXiv papers are less likely to be accepted for publication somewhere else at all!
- There might be a "Google Scholar bubble": less diversity in searching results; Matthew Effect
- Data, when processed, analyzed, or presented in a wrong way, can misinform.

Aim: To investigate how other people's expectations of the data influence people's reactions to a visualization: ability to recall, and the trust in, the data.

Hypotheses:

- H1: Social information leads to better recall of the data shown.

- H2: Congruence in social signals leads to higher trust, and higher likelihood of updating their beliefs. 

- H3a: Congruent-HighConsensus leads to higher trust and higher likelihood to update beliefs; Incongruent-HighCnsensus leads to the opposite results. 

- H3b: HighConsensus leads to better recall of the data. 

Results:

- H1 ‚ùå: The presence of social information has no impacts on data recall capability. 

- H2 ‚úîÔ∏è: Congruence improves trust, and the likelihood to update beliefs. 

- H3a ‚ùå: The level of Consensus has no impacts on trust and likelihood of belief update in both Congruent and Incongruent groups. 

- H3b ‚úîÔ∏è: HighConsensus leads to improved recall. 

Other findings (which do not seem preregistered):

1. Social information leads to improved recall when there is high consensus in the social signal. 

2. When participants had lower trust in the data even before seeing it, they are more likely to be swayed by the social information they see: lower trust in the data when others disagree with the data, and higher trust when others agree.

This study finds that when participants hold a neutral opinion on a topic or are weakly polarized, charts lead more people to change their views compared to tables (that communicate the same data as in charts). This pattern also exists among positively polarized participants.

A reverse pattern is observed among negatively polarized participants: more people change their opinion when presented with tables. It should be pointed out that this difference is statistically significant for only one of the three topics, although when aggregating the data from all the three topics, the difference is statistically significant.

Lots of publications on misinformation are based on data from social media or websites. However, a nationally representative survey finds that (1) news is a small fraction of media consumption; (2) online news is a small fraction of news consumption; and (3) fake news is only a tiny portion of the information Americans receive. 

The authors proposed a comprehensive research agenda that aims to achieve four objectives:

1. To build a large-scale data infrastructure to study the **production** (an updated catalog of relevant information), **consumption and distribution** (to measure people's news consumption continuously across all platforms: social media, desktop, email, instant messaging, etc.), **absorption and understanding** (whether news consumption changes people's beliefs), **action and engagement** (to see whether information people receive translates into action. For example, to protest, to volunteer, or simply to follow/retweet/like/comment on social media).

2. To build a "Mass Collaboration'' Model where people can replicate and accumulate knowledge. 

3. To communicate insights obtained from research to nonacademic people. One possible approach is to create data visualizations that constantly update new data. 

4. To build an academic-industry collaboration.

I didn't totally understand the details of this paper but I got the idea. To account for the pattern of meme popularity, meme lifetime, and user activity, The combination of (i) social media structure and (ii) the limited user attention is sufficient. The authors did not prove that the values of memes are not a factor in their popularity. However, they showed that it's possible to predict the pattern of memes on Twitter without considering the intrinsic values of memes. 

Fig. 2 shows that a user's "breadth of attention" is constant despite the growing number of posts/memes in social media. 

Fig. 3 shows that people are more likely to retweet something related to what they posted in the past. This means that memory is an important factor in meme competition.

### "A conversation with the past in your field"

A research paper is "a conversation with the past in your field". **"with the past"** means you need to show the connection of your present paper to the progress made in the past; **"in your field"**  means that you need to show how your work contributes to the development in your specific academic field. 

Remember that a research paper is not a lab report, not a technical blog post, not a how-to guide to software, not a news article, not a popular science article for the non-academic folks. To be accepted, your work has to show **its connection to the past** and **its contributions to the development within your chosen specific field**. 

### "Calibrating yourself to the norms of your field"

You need to read papers in your own field published in the past five years to get an idea of how other people in your field write papers. Innovating a way to write for research papers without invitation "is not stylish, it is just rude" ([Luke≈°, 2021](https://metaphorhacker.net/2021/01/the-nonsense-of-style-academic-writing-should-be-scrupulous-not-stylish/)). 

To calibrate yourself may take years. Working with your advisor can speed up this process. By observing how your advisor writes the paper, you can absorb the writing norms of your field much faster. 

It's [not very helpful to read general writing tips](https://metaphorhacker.net/2021/01/the-nonsense-of-style-academic-writing-should-be-scrupulous-not-stylish/):

> The first advice you need to give to an academic writer is not to read a book on stylish writing but rather to read how people in their field are writing. 

### Writing consistently and regularly

Don't expect a *perfect time* to write. It doesn't exist. When you write, first focus on the number of words. That's the easiest thing. Don't worry about the quality in the beginning. Just get the draft done and then you can improve it. If you expect your first few sentences to be perfect, you'll never start writing. 

### Pay close attention to the introduction

Always ask yourself, "so what?" You've done this study, so what? What problems does it solve? Why should it be published anyway? Who cares? 

The introduction should contain *the soul of your paper*. Keep tweaking it until the submission deadline. Many papers lack a soul because the writers don't spend enough time thinking/writing about the motivation and the value of their work. They submitted anyway. That's too bad. 

### Title, metadata, and abstract

Craft the title and abstract, and choose the right boxes to check (when submitting) in a way that can help your paper to be in the hands of the *right* people: scholars who have expertise in what you do. They want to see their academic lineage "carry on through the papers of newcomers like yourself". By contrast, those outside of your specific (sub)field do not appreciate your work and don't have incentives to have it published. 

### Quantity and quality

Quantity and quality aren't that different. Those who publish good work are also those who publish a lot of work. Therefore, don't procrastinate. Come up with ideas, do research, write, submit, revise, and publish. Just write! Writing will never be easy. You have to go through those *miseries* to get things done. 

### Acceptance and awards are random, but not that random

Don't submit papers you know aren't good enough. Don't waste reviewers' time. However, keep in mind that even the best work can be rejected. There is much randomness involved. 

That said, good papers always have higher chances of acceptance and winning awards.

Research statement: 4 pages, single-spaced, 12-point, 1.25-inch margin; The first 1.5 pages to describe your previous work, the next 1.5 pages to show your future research ideas, and the last page for a bibliography. 

### 2. Scheduling interviews

- Don't let your top choice be your first interview, as you'll most likely screw up the first one. 

- Never schedule more than one interview per week. You need time to relax. 

- To avoid delays, book direct flights. 

- When travelling on the plane, you can dress your shoes and coat for the interview, in case your luggage gets lost. 

### 3. Preparing for interviews

- For your job talk, practice, practice, practice. You need to practice a lot! You can practice in front of your colleagues and friends, who can then give you suggestions for improvement. 

- For one-on-one interviews, prepare a document of *talking points*. See Section 4.2 for more details. Whenever a professor asks you questions not in this document, add this question to it. 

### 4. Interviewing

- Pay attention to and be aware of why they brought you there in the first place. Is it because your research fits into the department's future agenda? Play up these parts in your talk and individual meetings. 

- Try to *Engage*, not to *impress*. Professors interviewing you have much more research experience and publications than you do. There is no need to impress others. 

#### 4.1 Job talk
- If you cannot *hook* the audience in the first 10 minutes, chances are your talk will just be mediocre. 

- **NEVER** say anything impromptu, i.e., only say what you have practiced! And **NEVER** exceed the time limit. Professors are busy and no one wants to spend more time than necessary on your talk. You should be mindful of the time limit of your talk even when you are answering questions from the audience. 

- What your job talk is supposed to show:

  1. "Solid past research". Start with the overarching motivation before diving into two specific projects you are most proud of. 
  2. "Compelling future research". Dedicate the final 10 minutes to this part. Be bold. 
  3. Capability + Personality. Through your talk, the audience should know that you are the person who will be successful academically and you will be a chill colleague. 

- You don't need to constantly tweak your talk. 

#### 4.2 One-on-one meetings with faculty

- You are supposed to chat casually with 10-20 faculty members in the department. Each chat is around 30 minutes. 

- *Be a good listener* and *Let the other person lead*. Try to listen to and talk about **their** research, not yours. 

#### 4.3 Department chair (or Department head) meeting

This is the most important meeting you'll have. Again, **be a good listener and let the other person lead the meeting**. Try to listen to and talk about the department's future vision. You can mention how that vision connects to your future research agenda. 

#### 4.4 Dean meeting

The dean is probably not involved in the hiring decisions. So just be chill. 

#### 4.5 Graduate students meeting

**Be nice** to students. Engate, inspire, and help them!

#### 4.6 Mealtime conversations

- It's still part of the interview! 

- Never gossip about anybody. 

- Ask some questions about living in this area, like the housing price. This shows your genuine interest in working there. 

### 5. Job talk revisited

- Again, never say anything impromptu. 

- Don't linger on slides. Just click "Next"!

- When switching to the next slide, don't say anything about it before you advance to it. 

- Minimize the use of a laser pointer. 

### 6. One-on-one meeting with faculty revisited

- You can take notes while talking, but only write down key words that help you write follow-up emails later. 

- What you can write about in your follow up emails: Thanking them for being interested in your research; for giving you suggestions for your research.

- Remeber to let **the other person** lead the meeting. Be comfortable with short sliences. It's better to let them control the meeting. Be a good listener. 

- During conversations with faculty, try to make **connections** with them. When they lead the talk and talk about their research, you can mention how their studies relate to yours. 

- Why are CONNECTIONS super important? Because if there are no connections at all, they won't even remember you and won't have anything to say about you after the meeting. 

- Try HARD to appeal to your "talk mates", even if they are in totally different subfields than yours. Everyone's vote accounts in hiring decisions. You cannot afford losing anyone's vote. 

- Be open, sincere, and honest. If they ask you where you are also applying besides their institution, let them know openly. 

- There is no need to spend TOO MUCH time getting to know every one of your "talk mates" beforehand. They know you are busy and don't expect that you know about their research in detail. 

- People sign up for meetings with you for a reason. For example, they may want to collaborate with you; they want to know whether your research strengthens the department research portfolio; or that they are on the faculty search committee. Only when you let the other party lead the meeting, and be a good listener, can you know what they want from you and then adapt accordingly. 

- Follow-up emails to people you talk to are VERY important. 

### 7. Other suggestions

- Be nice to the department admin. They'll let everybody know if they really hate you. 

- Try to focus on your job search. It's very important. It's OK not to have time to do research when you are doing tons of interviews. 

- When you get the offer from the school. Don't sound demanding when you negotiate. Don't be arrogant.

Guo, P. (2016). [*What I would've wanted to know as a first-year assistant professor*](https://pg.ucsd.edu/first-year-assistant-professor.htm)

- When you become a first-year assistant professor, you'll have a lot of free time. You only need to dedicate roughly six hours per week (3 hours to teaching, and 3 hours to department and committee meetings). You are free to do whatever you want for the rest of your time each week. **This freedom is the challenge**: you have to learn how to manage this free time. 

- Tenure. From the first day of your job, you have about five years to build up your publication list, submit your material in the sixth year, and hopefully get tenure. To get tenure, you need (1) to get recommendation letters from full professors detailing why you are the best in the field you are in; and (2) to have good relationships with tenured colleagues in your department so that they will interpret the recommendation letters in the most favorable light. For the first requirement, if your research is super innovative, then you risk not being able to find enough recommenders in your "field". 

- Even though tenure is a big thing, you shouldn't wishfully think that things will be better after you get tenure. Also, don't do something you don't enjoy simply to get tenure with the hope that you can do what you really love after tenure. Rather, be true to yourself, do what you love *right now*, and have a lifestyle you desire *right now*. 

- Back to time management, the key is to **prioritize**. Even though your life as a professor seems free, you have tons of things to do. Your time and energy is limited, so you have to prioritize the most important things and give up other no-so-important things. Otherwise, you won't have focused attention and energy to do your job well. 

- No need to be stressed out by tenure. It's easier to get tenure than to get fired as faculty.

This paper is very different from many papers I read, possibly because the author is an employee of the government. It aims to provide information for researchers interested in one topic, rather than to show a scientific result obtained through the author's research. It's an eye-opener for me, since it lets me know a different way of writing a paper. But I guess this format is very rare in the scientific community. It's more like a lab report.

### Study 1

- Purpose: To see whether mistaken belief is sufficient to explain the sharing of misinformation. 

- Procedure: 1015 participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants are presented with headlines, lead sentences, and images for 36 news stories obtained from social media. Half of these stories were entirely false and the other half are true. Half of the headlines are favorable to Democrats and the other half favorable to Republicans. Participants were randomly assigned to decide either the veracity of the headline they saw (accuracy condition) or their intention to share the story (sharing condition).

- Results: 

  - In the accuracy condition, true headlines are rated as accurate significantly more often than false headlines. Whereas politically concordant headlines are rated as accurate more than politically discordant headlines, this difference stemming from political alignment is significantly smaller than the veracity-driven difference. 

  - In the sharing condition, the difference in sharing intention based on political alignment is significantly larger than the veracity-driven difference. 

  - Across conditions: the effect of headline veracity is significantly larger in the accuracy condition than in the sharing condition; the effect of political alignment is significantly larger in the sharing condition than in the accuracy condition. 

There is a disconnect between accuracy rating and sharing intention: even though very few Republicans rated a headline as accurate in the accuracy condition, many Republicans in the sharing condition intend to share it. This disconnection disputes the confusion theory (which states that people share misinformation because they do not know the information is false): People can detect the falsehood, but decide to share it nonetheless.

People do care about veracity when deciding whether to share or not, according to a study (Coppock & McClellan, 2019). Then, why do people knowingly share misinformation? The authors of the current study formulate the idea that the context of social media primed people to please followers or signal their membership.

### Study 3 & Study 4

Control condition: participants are shown 24 news headlines (half true & half false; half favorable to Democrats & half favorable to Republicans) and asked how likely they are to share each headline on Facebook. 

Treatment condition: participants are asked to rate the accuracy of **one single non-partisan** news headline at the start of the experiment and then go on to go through the same procedure as in the control condition. 

As shown in Figure 2, participants in the treatment condition are significantly less likely to consider sharing false news headlines than those in the control condition. This treatment effect is significantly larger for politically concordant headlines than for politically discordant news. However, participants in the two conditions are equally likely to consider sharing true headlines. 

In Study 3, the difference in sharing intention for veracious versus fake headlines is 2.0 times bigger in the treatment condition relative to the control condition. This figure is 2.4 in Study 4. 

In both studies, participants in both conditions when asked after the experiment do not differ significantly in how important it is to share only veracity.

### Study 5

A more representative group of participants are recruited through Lucid. 

Besides the two conditions in Study 3 & 4, there are also an active condition (in which participants are asked to rate the humorousness rather than the veracity of a single news headline before the experiment) and an importance treatment condition (in which participants before the experiment are asked about the importance they attached to only sharing true content). The results replicated those in Study 3 and 4. See Fig. 2-c. 

As Fig. 3 a-c shows, there exists a positive correlation between the perceived accuracy (rated categorically as 1-7, with 7 indicating the most accurate) and the treatment effect in Study 3, 4, & 5. For each headline, the treatment effect is measured as the `$Sharing intention_{treatment condition} - Sharing intention_{control condition}$`.

This positive correlation means that the least accurate news headlines are the ones that the "accuracy salience treatment" discouraged people from sharing the most. 

Study 7: I do not understand it. It seems that this part is written by a different person. But I know the conclusion of Study 7: the accuracy message led Twitter users who frequently share misinformation to increase the quality of the content they share. 

Overall, this article supports the idea that shifting people's attention to accuracy discourages them from sharing misinformation.

I agree. The most important thing about writing is getting the first draft down, even with tears on your face. Don't procrastinate. Don't expect the first draft to be elegant. You just need to get enough words, which will make you less anxious (as you now have a draft, as shitty as it is). Then you can spend more time later editing it.

I read only PP. 32-33. 

The trick here is that you need to separate *generating* text from *editing*. These two activities involve different activities. 

When generating texts, don't look at the words you've produced, and don't think about the quality. Just write down what's in your mind. *Editing* is another job you'll do later, not now. 

After generating enough texts, then you can edit them.

- People tend to post positive things in their Rinsta (i.e., real Instagram accounts) and negative (but authentic) things in their Finsta (i.e., false Instagram accounts). They want to present a polished and emotional-free self on their Rinsta. Self-presentation can be coarse and emotional on Finsta. People might also talk about taboo activities on their Finsta. 

- People treat Rinsta and Finsta differently because they are targeting different audiences. 

- Since people might have multiple accounts in the same social media and use these accounts differently, surveying people their experiences of using this medium might lead to wrong conclusions.

- As an author, you should shoulder the responsibility of **convincing the reader of the contribution of your work**.

- Some reviewers may conclude that your paper should be rejected before they read all of your content. Therefore, their criticism will only be for the first few pages. It is wrong to conclude that they are satisfied with the remaining part of your paper. 

- If reviewers comment that your work lacks a thorough literature review, you should not assume that adding some references will solve the problem. This kind of criticism implies that they don't think your work is important in the context of extant research. 

- Reviewers might send confidential comments to editors and associated editors, which are invisible to you. 

- If your paper is rejected by a journal and you decide to submit it to another journal after revision, you should send a note to the editor explaining the history of your work. Do not simply do "journal shopping". 

- Be objective, emotionally detached, and friendly in your response to reviewers' comments. No matter how offended you feel, do not insult reviewers' competence or their motives. Be "gracious, humble, and constructive".

- If reviewers do not appear to understand your paper, take the responsibility, explain, clarify, and educate, rather than attacking reviewers' competence. 

- Even if you feel a criticism is unjustified, and no revision for it is necessary, it's better to make relevant changes according to the criticism and describe your improvements. You can make your points clearer if you feel they are correct, rather than arguing no revision is needed, which sounds arrogant to the reviewers. 

- In your response, use different fonts to distinguish between quoting reviewers, your reply, and quoting text in your revised paper.

- Experiment 2: Showing people information about variability in individual outcomes alleviates people's overestimation of treatment effectiveness when presented only with mean differences (which was conveyed through 95% CI with visualizations, the most misleading format in Experiment 1). Among all methods to convey outcome uncertainty, telling people directly the probability of superiority is the most effective (at alleviating overestimation).  

- Experiment 3: Combining the method of "telling people directly probability of superiority" with any of the other four methods (category, variance, height analogy, and weather analogy) did not statistically significantly reduce people's willingness to pay. Adding additional information did not have negative impacts either (except when weather analogy was applied). 

- Experiment 4: Even if mean differences are conveyed through four other methods (in Experiment 1) rather than 95% CI with visualizations, telling people afterwards directly probability of superiority reduces their willingness to pay, compared to when showing people only *inferential uncertainty* through 95% CI with visualizations.

- Outcome uncertainty is more useful for individuals than inferential uncertainty. The former is predicting what an individual outcome is likely to be, whereas the latter one shows the group average. It's possible that the group with a larger mean has more variability, whereas the other group (with a smaller mean) is more reliable. Wise people will choose the second one rather than the first one.

   - Cohen's *d*, expressed as `$d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma}$`, conveys information about both the treatment effect and the variability in individual outcomes.

- People tend to overestimate the effect size and understated the variability in outcomes when presented 95% confidence intervals that show *inferential* uncertainty, compared to when presented 95% prediction intervals that show *outcome* uncertainty. 

  For example, suppose we are comparing heights of men with those of women: 

    - *Inferential* uncertainty is how confident we are about our estimation of **each group's average height**, based on **our measurement**. So error bars will extend 1.96 (sometimes 1.0) *standard error* above and below the mean. 

    - *Outcome* uncertainty is the variability of **each individual's height around their group's mean**. Therefore, error bars will extend 1.96 (sometimes 1.0) *standard deviation* above and below the mean. 

  See Fig. 1 for illustration. 

- People have the largest misperceptions when the effect size is small. Unfortunately, small effect sizes are the norm in scientific studies, which use 95% CI more often than 95% PI. This indicates that readers are likely to exaggerate the scientific results they encounter.

Artificial intelligence is powered by deep learning, which are algorithms that use statistics to identify patterns in data. This capability enables computers to mimic human skills, and to provide recommendations to users (for example, in Google, Facebook, and Netflix).

Papers in arXiv's artificial intelligence section focused on machine learning in around 1995-2005, on neural networks in around 2010-2015, and on reinforcement learning in around 2015-2019. 

Before around 2005, papers in arXiv's AI section focused on "knowledge-based reasoning", trying to recreate human seasoning using man-made rules. After around 2005, the attention changed to machine learning, which is a parent term that includes deep learning. Rather than writing rules, machine learning trains computer programs to extract rules from a sea of data.

Besides neural networks, there are other machine learning methods, for example, "bayesian networks‚Äù, "markov methods‚Äù, and "support vector machines", but neural networks have dominated the playground since around 2016. 

Three types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning wasn't a new idea, but it didn't gain much momentum until AlphaGo's groundbreaking success.

People overestimated both error and variance of effect size when only told the mean differences. 95% confidence intervals with visualizations led to the largest overestimation, as shown in Figure 2. Presending the mean differences in absolute or percentage terms, or simply telling people difference exists, made people overestimate the effect size as well, but to a lesser degree.

Informing people the variability helped alleviate this issue, with directly telling people the probability of superiority performing the best (although the difference did not reach statistical significance).

- As Fig. 1(B) shows, the percentage of publications in both *Nature* and *Physical Review D* by new PIs have been decreasing in the past two decades. The figure also shows that different types of journals have different patterns regarding the share of papers by different categories of PIs. 

- Chaperone effect `$C$` is measured as

   `$$ c / c_{random} $$`

   where `$c$` is the ratio of **the number of authors who became last authors from non-last authors** to **the number of those who never made this transition**. `$c_random$` is the same ratio but in a system where the order of authors is randomly permuted. This randomization is necessary if we want to compare the chaperone effect of different scientific fields. If we measure the chaperone effect by `$c$` rather than `$C$`, we fail to consider the fact that `$c$` might be influenced by individual productivity, team size, or simply random factors. 

   If `$C$` is larger one 1, then the chaperone effect exists. 

- Fig. 2 shows that the chaperone effect is strongest in interdisciplinary fields, biology, and medicine, and weakest in Mathematics. 

- An interesting question to ask is whose papers have more impact, those by new PIs, or those by chaperoned and established PIs. The authors assumed that those by new PIs have more impact because it is difficult to publish in a journal, say, in *Nature*, if you didn't have a publication record there. However, results show that papers by established and chaperoned PIs receive more citations. 

- The chaperone effect is stronger in prestigious, interdisciplinary journals with a general audience than in field-specific journals.

- People who base their viewpoints on personal experiences (rather than on facts) are considered more rational and are respected more by their opponents. Opponents are also more willing to interact with them. 

- To increase perceived rationality, personal experiences are better to be relevant, and harm-based.

I did not really understand the details of this paper. That said, the conclusion is clear:

Dogmatic individuals are less likely to seek out additional information, especially when their initial decisions are uncertain. This is worrisome because after dogmatic people encounter fake news, they are less likely to seek out correcting pieces.

- As can be seen in [Fig. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/118/4/e2016976118/F1.large.jpg), both current happiness (experienced well-being) and remembered happiness (evaluative well-being) grow linearly with **log(income)**, **without a plateau**. 

- Larger household income below $80,000 had a stronger correlation with decreased negative feelings compared to people having household income above $80,000. Positive feelings grow evenly across the income range. 

- Sense of control of one's life explained 74% of the relationship between income and experienced well-being. 

- People having smaller household income were happier if they attributed less importance to money; Those who earned a lot were happier if they attributed more importance to money. 

- Across the income range, the more people equated money and success, the less happier they felt. 

- The main difference of this study is that 1) respondents responded in real time when they saw the prompts from the app; 2) happiness was measured using a continuous rather than dichotomous scale. 

I like this study.

- Men were more likely than women to express greater commitment to completing the PhD and continuing research in the chemistry field. **Amazingly, within each gender group, URM students were more likely to do so.**

- When we do not consider other factors, students having a supportive advisor were more likely to finish the PhD, find a postdoc, and have an academic career at a research institute. However, this positive effect on women is not found in bigger and more renowned chemistry departments.

### Results

- Prior to graduation, the level of self-efficacy of women is lower than that of men.

- Without considering any other factors, self-efficacy is positively related to salary in initial jobs. 

- For engineering and CS undergraduates, in their first jobs after they graduate, women's salaries are lower than men's. 

- Gender does not predict how important salary is to a person. 

- Women do emphasize workplace culture more, but this emphasis is associated with higher rather than lower compensation. 

- Self-efficacy is a significant mediator for the relationship between being female and the salary. (See [Figure S5](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2020/11/11/2010269117.DCSupplemental/pnas.2010269117.sapp.pdf))

This paper investigates why there is a gender pay gap among STEM graduates. They hypothesized that engineering self-efficacy (ESE) is the reason. To test this hypothesis, they surveyed 559 college students majoring in engineering and computer science in 2015 (when students are still enrolled in the program), 2016, and later in 2017 when students just graduated and entered the workforce. 

### Theories 

Two possible reasons why women earn less: 1) women are socialized to believe money is not as important as family; 2) women prefer inclusive environments to competitive ones, with the latter more favorable to higher salaries.

Andrasfay, T., & Goldman, N. (2021). Reductions in 2020 US life expectancy due to COVID-19 and the disproportionate impact on the Black and Latino populations. *PNAS, 118*(5).

- The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to cause a decline in 2021 US life expectancy by 1.13 y. This decline is larger than that in other developed countries, which already had higher life expectancy than the US before the pandemic. 

- The reduction in life expectancy in the US is not the same for each racial group. The reduction for Black (2.10 y) and Latino (3.05 y) is much larger than that for Whites (0.68 y). 

- For Black and Latino populations, younger people face a higher burden of mortality related to the COVID-19. This might be because their jobs are less compatible with remote working and therefore they have to expose themselves to viruses to earn money during the pandemic. 

- These racial differences in reduction in life expectancy will result in 39% increase in the life expectancy gap between the Black population and Whites (from 3.6 y in 2017 to 5.06 y in 2020). The life expectancy advantage that Latino population has relative to Whites will decrease from 3.3 y in 2017 to 0.93 y in 2020, a 70% plunge.

Finished Luhrmann et al. (2021)

This study tries to answer **why some people are more likely than others to experience the presence of gods and spirits**. In four studies, the authors, possibly among others, interviewed and surveyed local residents having faith (in charismatic evangelical Christianity or the local religion) and urban undergraduate students in four places: US, Ghana, Thailand and China. 

The study found that **porosity** and **absorption** played distinct roles in people's spiritual experiences across different cultures and religions. 

**Porosity** is a cultural attribution that defines the boundary between "mind" and the "world". People living in cultures of different levels of porosity might have different viewpoints on whether their mental experiences come from and have influences on the outside world. 

**Absorption** is a personal tendency to be immersed in their own minds.

- 98,847 people registered to participate in a "global search" task. They were to reach the person assigned to them via email. To do so, they were asked to relay the message to people they think are "closer" to their target. Receivers of the relayed message were asked to do the same thing. 18 targets were from the US, Estonia, Indian, Australia and Norway. 

- 61,168 people from 166 countries relayed the message, generating 24,163 message chains. More than half of these people were middle class and college educated North Americans. (Background information: the study was published in 2003.)

- Two reasons stood out when people were asked why they sent a message to specific recipients: geographical proximity, and similar occupation. 

- Hubs were not important for the success of searches.

- Weak ties are important. 

- It is important that people have incentives to proceed or confidence in the search; otherwise, it's difficult to reach the target.

The authors proposed a model: "container model". This model, if given the trajectories of an individual, can infer the hierarchical levels of the mobility traces, and the size of each level. Based on the mobility traces of more than 700K people, the authors found that the mobility of these people has four hierarchical levels. This means that day-to-day human mobility is not scale-free. However, when we aggregate displacements across containers (I do not fully understand what this means, though), human mobility is scale-free. 

Fig. 2 shows that container models do a much better job than other models in predicting mobility traces.

The authors got access to detailed cell records data of 1.5 million subscribers in Rwanda. They did a phone survey involving 856 individuals, who were among the 1.5 million subscribers. The authors built a model that can predict an individual's wealth based on these 856 individuals' answers and their cell records. The authors used this model to predict the wealth of Rwanda by district and found that it very well matched the actual wealth index as computed from a national survey of over 10k households in Rwanda. 

The authors argued that administering a national survey is very slow and costly. Predicting wealth from cell phone data is fast and relatively cheap. This method is accessible because a considerable number of people in developing countries are using cell phones now.

Does exposure to social media increase or decrease belief polarization? This study tries to answer this question via a field experiment lasting for one and a half months on Twitter. The authors hired a company to recruit Twitter users who identify themselves as Republicans and Democrats. 1652 people participated in the study (901 Democrats and 751 Republicans). 

Later, participants were invited to follow a Twitter bot that would retweet 24 messages/day for a month. The bot was designed to retweet counterattitudinal messages to the participants, i.e., Democrats would be assigned to a conservative bot and Republicans to a liberal bot. Participants did not know what types of bots they were going to be assigned to. Among those invited to follow a bot, 64.9% of Democrats and 57.2% of Republicans accepted the invitation. 

[Fig. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/37/9216/F1.large.jpg) provides an excellent summary of the experiment procedure.

- Social networks of those following pages of Places of Worship, Community Amenities, Bars and Pubs, Indoor Recreation, and Performing Arts had two types of members: core members who are closely connected with each other, and other members who are loosely-connected. This is called a "core-periphery structure". A network with this structure indicates that there are "regulars" who visit the place often. Non-regulars tend to be friends of a "regular". 

- The fact that people do similar things in two places does not mean that the two social networks have more similarities. For example, the friendship network of Bars and Pubs is closer to that of Community Amenities than to that of Restaurants.

### Publication trends

- The use of question or exclamation marks in paper titles is increasing (< 1% in 1950 to >3% in 2013).

- The percentage of papers with authors listed in an alphabetical order more than halved, from 21.0% in 1950 to 43.5% in 2014.

- Paper abstracts are getting longer, from a mean of 116.3 words in 1970 to 179.8 words in 2014.

- Self-citation: both the number of self-citations and the percentage of papers containing self-citations increased. 

- The mean and median length of academic papers decreased: 14.4 pages in 1950, 10.1 in 1990, and 8.4 in 2014. 

### Author trends

- Early-career scientists now are publishing more papers but are less likely to be the first authors, compared to those decades ago. 

### Journal trends

- Both the number of journals and the number of papers published per journal each year increased. 

- For papers in top journals, the mean career age of first and last authors and the percentage of returning authors increased.

Here, the two authors said that "These results support our hypothesis that the citation number has become a target." 

I am a little bit doubtful of this conclusion. Although it seems true instinctively, it does call for casual data. I do not think they can reach this conclusion only by observing a correlation between the discussed trends and the number of citations.

   4. Paper titles lengths are increasing.
   5. Reference lists are getting longer. Few papers had over 20 references back in 1960 but now it is common to have papers with more than 40 references. 

### Material

As mentioned before, MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph) was used. The MAG dataset contains 120.7 million papers but many of them are news papers, comments, and responses. The two authors filtered these out, analyzing only around 22 million papers that have a DOI and at least five references. Only authors of these 22 million papers were analyzed. 

The authors of this paper also used the AMiner open academic graph dataset, which is relatively new.

- What have been increasing: 
  - number of published papers yearly (from fewer than 1 million in 1980 to more than 7 million in 2014)
  - speed of sharing papers (researchers can share their studies via non-traditional channels such as preprint servers)
  - number of peer-reviewed journals
  - number of published researchers

- What haven't been changed for decades: measures of scientific success (number of publications, impact factor, h-index)

- Goodhart's Law: 

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

- **Study Material**: The two authors of this paper analyzed over 120 million published papers with 528 million references and 35 million authors, since the early 1800s. The data came from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) dataset. 

- **Study Purpose**: Are researchers focusing on attaining success metrics rather than the quality of research?

- Changes in scientific publication:
  1. Popularity of preprint servers such as arXiv, bioRxiv, SSRN, and RePEc
  2. Mega-journals that value scientific trustworthiness rather than novelty. Prime examples are *PloS One* and *Scientific Reports*.

- Scientific papers that appeared in policy documents received on average 40 times more citations from other scientific papers than those not found in policy documents. This indicates that papers referenced in government policy documents were also well received and respected in the scientific community. 

- Although preprint servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, and SSRN) released much more papers on the COVID-19, papers published in peer-reviewed journals appeared more frequently in policy documents. See Fig. 2.3. 

- Policy documents grounded in rigorous scientific findings received more citations from other policy documents. 

- National governments produced more policy documents than think tanks and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), but they cited science the least. IGOs, especially WHO, used science the most. 

I like this paper. Short and practical. It uses inferential statistics sparingly, so its findings seem more robust to me.

### Aim of the study
To explain why success in the cultural market is different from average performance and yet very difficult to anticipate even for experts. 

### Study design:

- 14,341 participants were recruited from a teen-interest website. They were randomly assigned to two conditions (independent vs. social influence) and rated 48 songs by different bands. 
  - In the independent condition, participants were only shown the name of the bands and the songs. After listening to a song, they were asked to rate it; the rating ranged from 1 to 5. After rating, they were given the choice to download the song, although they were not required to do so. 

  - In the social influence condition, participants also saw how many times a song has been downloaded by previous participants. 

  - There were eight "worlds" to which participants in the social influence condition were assigned to. Each world is parallel to each other, meaning that the number of downloads in one world does not affect other worlds. 

- The authors of this paper conducted two experiments. 

  - In experiment 1, 48 songs were presented in a `$16 \times 3$` grid where the order of the songs was random. In experiment 1, participants in the social condition saw the number of downloads along with the name of the band whereas participants in the independent condition did not see this information. 

  - In experiment 2, songs were presented in a single column. For participants in the social condition in experiment 2, the songs were shown in descending order of current downloaded counts, whereas the order was random for participants in the independent condition in experiment 2. 

  - Why did the authors conduct two experiments? Through this design, in each experiment, the authors can see the effects of social influence on the success of each song. Furthermore, they can see the effect of increased "strength" of related information signals (i.e., downloaded numbers) by comparing the results of two experiments (for the social influence condition). 

### Results

Social influence, i.e., information about the choice of others, contributed to both **inequality** and **unpredictability** of the songs. 

  - [Fig. 1](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/311/5762/854/F1.large.jpg) shows that there is more inequality when social influence is present. This is because, as we can see, the dark bars are consistently taller than the light bars. It also shows that an increased level of social influence leads to increased level of inequality. 

  - Fig. 2 shows that as social influence increases, it becomes more unpredictable to tell whether a song turns out to be good or bad.

- Is it possible that the above mentioned epidemiological patterns were due to increasing testing capacity rather than travel restrictions?

The authors of the paper introduced a binary variable of testing capacity, whose value was "low" before 2020-01-20, the date when COVID-19 was categorized as a class B notifiable disease, and "high" after 2020-01-20. Compared to the naive model (see the end of p.1 of the paper for detail regarding this model), inclusion of human mobility data from Wuhan alone led to improvements in the model's prediction for 12 provinces (among 27 provinces that reported cases through 2020-02-06). In 10 other provinces, both testing capacity and human mobility from Wuhan improved prediction. Only for Hunan did testing alone contributed the most to the model's prediction. Therefore, the authors concluded that although testing capacity is important, in the early stage of the epidemic, Wuhan lockdown was the most important "driver of spread" (p. 3).

I admire this work.

- The volume and frequency of human movement from Wuhan to other places in China predicted the size of the early epidemic in other provinces.

- After 2020-02-01, daily case counts became less correlated with human movement from Wuhan. This indicates that variability among different places in daily case counts was more likely due to factors other than human mobility from Wuhan before the Wuhan lockdown. This also indicates that travel restrictions are important in the early phase of epidemic control, but later, the importance of other local mitigation methods increased. 

- From 2020-01-09 to 2020-01-22, variation in the epidemic's growth rate in provinces outside of Hubei was almost entirely explained by human mobility from Wuhan. After drastic control measures were taken across China, growth rates became negatively correlated with human movement from Wuhan; that is to say, provinces with more human mobility from Wuhan before the lockdown saw smaller growth rates.

The *Q*-model corrected the two shortcomings of the *R*-model. 

According to the Q-model:

- A paper's potential impact `$p_\alpha$` is independent of a scientist's productivity `$N_i$` and parameter `$Q_i$`, which means that there is luck behind the impact. 

- High *Q* is only slightly correlated with higher *N*. 

Then the question is, what the hidden parameter of *Q* is, and what it indicates? According to the authors, *Q* is a constant ability to turn a project with randomly picked impact into high-impact. For each scientist, this ability is **a constant** (for 76% of all scientists); it does not grow with the development of the career stage. 

PP. 5-7

## 2020-12-23
Continued with Sinatra et al. (2016)

So, what is the role of a scientist's ability in impact generation?

The authors first created a **Random-impact model (R-model)**. This model assumes that no matter for whom, the impact of each scientific paper is randomly chosen from the same impact distribution `$P(c_{10})$`. Then, the only difference scientists is **productivity `$N$`**: how many papers she gets published in her career. This model accurately predicts the cumulative function of `$P(\ge N^*/N)$` (Fig. 2E). However, this model has two problems:

1. If each paper's impact is randomly selected from a universal distribution of `$P(c_{10})$`, then a scientist with a higher `$N$` will be more likely to have a higher `$c^*_{10}$`, i.e., the citation of the highest impact paper. However, the R-model fails to predict this. See Fig. 3C. 

2. Scientists with a higher average impact without `$c^*_{10}$` will also score higher on `$c^*_{10}$`. That is to say, high impact papers are more likely to be produced by a scientist with a constantly high impact. Again, the R-model fails to predict this. See Fig. 3D. 

The authors then proposed an alternative model, **Q-model**. This model assumes that (1) as in the R-model, each paper's impact is randomly selected from a universal distribution of `$P(c_{10})$`, and (2) each scientist `$i$` has a unique value `$Q_i$` that modulates impact. `$Q_i$` is a constant throughout a scientist's career. The impact of a paper published by a scientist `$i$` is the product of `$Q_i$`, and `$p_\alpha$` randomly drawn from the distribution `$P(p)$` which is the same for all scientists .

- Fig. 2E: The random impact rule is further confirmed by Fig. 2E. This figure captures the cumulative distribution of `$P(\ge N^*/N)$`, where `$N^*/N$` denotes when the highest-impact paper of a scientist occurs. The fact that it is a straight line indicates that the highest-impact factor can appear anytime within a scientist's career. 

- Fig. 2A: We can clearly see the differences in impacts across three levels impact scientists. What's the reason behind it: increasing productivity or increasing creativity? The authors again randomized the papers' impact while keeping scientists' productivity unchanged. The results for both high- and low- impact scientists remained unchanged. Therefore, differences in scientists can be better explained by productivity (see Fig. 1E)

P. 3

## 2020-12-21
Continued with Sinatra et al. (2016)

- A first look at Fig. 2D might tell us that the chance to publish the highest-impact paper drops with age. However, when the impact of papers was randomized, while keeping a scientist's productivity each year unchanged, the distribution of the timing of `$t^*$` remains almost the same. This is a very important finding, as it means that a scientist can produce her highest impact paper **anytime** in her career. 

P.3 

{{<block class="note">}}
I am not sure whether it's only the order of a scientist's papers that was randomized or that the order remains unchanged but papers' `$c_{10}$` were randomized. The authors did not make this point crystal clear.

- Productivity and impact are metrics to gauge a scientist's performance. 

- Fig. 1B: Only 5% of all the scientists analyzed have at least one paper that received 200 or more citations after its publication. 

- Fig. 1C and 1E: High impact scientists are also much more productive. Medium impact scientists started with more publications than the other two groups (high and low impact). In the first three years following the first publication, medium impact scientists have more publications than the other two groups, but high impact scientists quickly catch up: it took ten more years for the medium impact scientists to have the same number of publications as high impact scientists, and the figure for low impact scientists is 40 more years. 

- For a scientist, the timing of the highest-impact paper is truly uniform within the career, meaning that he or she can do ground-breaking work anytime within his or her academic career.

One point worth noticing is that the negative effect of susceptibility to believing in false rumors on vaccine acceptance is stronger than the positive effect of exposure to fact-checked vaccination-related information.

## 2020-12-16

Continued with Singh et al. (2020)

### Research question

Whether (1) exposure to false rumors, (2) exposure to these false rumors' fact-checks, and (3) the perceived believability of each rumor ("believability") are related to the willingness to get vaccinated ("vaccine acceptance"). 

### Methods 

From 2020-06-18 to 2020-07-13, the study survey was promoted in five languages (English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Arabic) on Facebook Advertising Platform. More than 44k Facebook users from 152 countries did the survey. The authors discarded (1) incomplete and duplicated responses, and (2) responses from countries with fewer than 30 respondents. The final dataset is over 805k responses from over 18k people in 40 countries. 

The survey was quite simple, as it only comprised of three questions:

>1. Have you seen or heard this information in the past month? 
>2. Have you ever seen an official source confirming or denying this claim?
>3. How believable does this information seem to you?

At the end of the survey, the respondents were also asked to provide demographic information, and to indicate the extent they saw the coronavirus as a threat ("perceived threat").

### Results

1. Exposure to misinformation, and perceived threat are positively related to believability. 

2. Exposure to misinformation alone is not strongly correlated with vaccine acceptance. However, the believability of false information is **negatively** correlated with vaccine acceptance. 

3. Exposure to **vaccine-related misinformation** is positively correlated with vaccination hesitancy, and the believability of false **vaccine-related rumors**. Exposure to fact-checked vaccination-related information is positively correlated with vaccine acceptance. 

4. Exposure, believability, and fact-checking of other types of false rumors are not correlated with vaccine acceptance. 

5. Perceived threat is positively correlated with vaccine acceptance.

Major findings: 1) Even though more journal articles published long ago became available online, scientists tend to cite more recent papers; 2) Even though more articles are becoming online, fewer journals and articles are being cited, and citations become concentrated on fewer journals and articles.

Evans (2008) explains that this might be because scholars find it easier to locate prevailing opinions if they search online. Journals and articles that scholars might skim in the print age now are overlooked, pushing the citation to newer and fewer articles. This is alarming because it indicates that as online journals become more available, scientific studies are building upon fewer, rather than more, ideas.

The title of this paper explains the main finding. One point worth noticing is that, as the authors mentioned at the end of the paper, fundings from the government for individuals or small teams do not enable smaller teams to produce disruptive results. This is because small teams funded by the government don't want to take the risk of entering uncharted areas. 

This paper explains my intuition: more and more scientists, and more and more money invested in research, do not necessarily mean more ground-breaking results. Also, I don't believe large teams should always dominate the science community. I also don't think it's a good idea to always promote publications with a massive number of individuals. Teamwork is great, but does not always produce disruptive work.

Key question: technologies give people more choices regarding consuming news. How does this affect the overall news consumption pattern? Do audiences become more fragmented (i.e., "audiences disperse among the higher number of choices")?

Conclusions:

1. Selective exposure exists but it does not grow in magnitude amongst increasing choices of news content.

2. The pattern and effect of consuming news on desktop are different than that of consuming news on multiplatform, with the later reaching increasingly larger audiences, attracting more time spent on news consumption, and making audiences less fragmented. 

3. More than half of the US population access little to no news. These people might also be susceptible to misinformation.

Study design:

Data about family and children were available only for waves 1-5 (from child birth to age 9) but not available yet for wave 6 (child age 15). Researchers tried to predict the results (child GPA, child grit, household eviction, household material hardship, caregiver layoff, and caregiver participation in job training) of wave 6 based on the whole data for waves 1-5 and half of the data for wave 6. 

Result:

Scientists leveraging complicated machine learning algorithms could not predict those outcomes correctly. If a score of 1 means perfectly accurate, and 0 not accurate at all, the best predictions got a score of 0.2 for material hardship and child GPA, and only 0.05 for the other four outcomes. Also note that a linear regression or logistic regression model with only four variables chosen by domain experts were only slightly worse than the best submission, and were much better than most of the other submissions.

### Key question: 

1. Can dimensions of tie strength predict tie strength? How?
2. Limitations of this model?

### Methods
Participants on Facebook answered five tie strength questions for as many friends as possible within half an hour, ending up with 2184 Facebook friendships rated. 

The five questions are: How strong is the relationship, how comfortable to ask for a loan, how helpful if looking for a job, how upset if unfriended, and how important to bring a friend to a new channel if need be. (See Table 2)

Independent variables: The researchers then used 74 Facebook variables (such as Wall and words in the *inbox*) to predict intensity, intimacy, duration, reciprocal services, structure, emotional support, and social distance. (See Table 1) Participants also answered questions regarding their demographic and Facebook usage, and their friends' Facebook  usage.

Dependent variables: answers from participants for the five questions mentioned above.

Many papers on the strength of weak ties do not answer the question of whether weak ties carry **important** or **novel** information.

To answer this question, we can test whether users pay more attention to information travelled through a weak tie. But how can we measure "attention"? A reasonable proxy is the number of friends a user has in a social network. 

Result:

1. Strong ties carry more traffic, confirming that people communicate more with close friends.

### Central question
Does information exchange in bipartisan communication networks increase or decrease partisan bias?

### Literature
What is the drawback of previous studies: people had conversations, so that researchers could not distinguish between the effect of partisan priming, and that of opposing views. 

### Design & Procedure

Four groups:

A control group in which participants had **the same** political ideology;

Group 2, 3, and 4 are all structured social networks with an equal number of conservatives and liberals. Group 2 were only shown the average of their 4 network neighbors, without any other information exhibited. Group 3 were shown the average of their neighbors plus the logos of political parties. Group 4 were shown the average as well, along with the neighbors political identity. 

Each group provided estimates for three times. For the first round, each member estimated independently. 

In Round 2 and Round 3, the control group revised their answers independently. Group 2 revised their answers while being exposed to their neighbors' average answer. Group 3 revised their answer while being exposed to Republican and Democratic party logos below their neighbors' average estimate. Group 4 revised their response while being shown the usernames, political identification, and the average of each of their four neighbors, and the average of these four neighbors' answers.

### Results
Group 2: both liberals and conservatives improved their trend accuracy, with an elimination of partisan bias in interpreting climate change data. Even conservatives in this group predicted trends significant more accurately than liberals in the control condition. 

Group 3: there was no effect of social learning, and belief polarization in Round 1 was maintained. 

Group 4: trend accuracy improved but moderate belief polarization remained. 

(Belief polarization means that liberals significantly outperformed conservatives in predicting climate change trends.) 

- Exposure to logos of political parties had a stronger effect on decreasing the impact of social learning than exposure to neighbors' political identity. 

- Both conservatives and liberals improved their prediction accuracy thanks to information exchange in networks, even when exposed to their network neighbors' political identification. 

### Robustness check
Can social learning reduce polarization in homogeneous networks (i.e., networks that are not bipartisan)? Robustness tests showed that **the effect of social learning was reduced in politically homogeneous networks**: by Round 3, trend accuracy of conservatives in these echo chambers did not differ significantly from conservatives in the control condition. 

{{<block class="reminder">}}
Considering this result, instead of saying the effect of social learning was **reduced**, I think it's more accurate to say it was **removed**.
{{<end>}}

Another question is whether the effect of social learning remains if participants in Group 4 were shown individual answers rather than an average. Results showed that the effect of social learning was robust to exposure to individual responses.

{{<block class="reminder">}}
I am very puzzled by the result. It showed that the effect of social learning was eliminated in homogeneous networks, but the paper of *the wisdom of partisan crowds* showed exactly [the opposite result](/en/apad/#2020-11-16-edited-on-2020-11-19-and-2020-11-20).

### Conclusion & suggestion
It's better to have political discussions in bipartisan networks without partisan cues.

- Complex contagions require a critical mass to start a large-scale cascade and critical mass is dependent on network topology, node degree distribution, and adoption thresholds. 

New directions:

1. Ecologies of complex contagions: how several contagions interact with each other within a network and across networks. 

{{<block class="note">}}

The following were added on 2020-11-22

2. Heterogeneity of thresholds

Thresholds of contagions vary. Different people and different activities may have different thresholds. 

3. Homophily and diversity in diffusion

Identity-based diversity means one's neighbors have different characteristics. Structural diversity means one's neighbors belong to different components of the network. The first kind of diversity **reduces** the spreading of complex contagions whereas the second one **amplifies** it.

If one has too many friends, he or she might not be an ideal target of complex contagions. This is because complex contagions need multiple reinforcement. When you have too many friends, you receive fewer repeated exposure. Therefore, "clustered, homophilous networks" are conducive to complex contagions. 

  - How do people infer global structure from their local interactions?
  - How do future social media networks facilitate (or reduce?) these inferences by giving people more (or less?) information about their broader ego network?

**Aim**: to see whether there is "wisdom of crowds" in politically homogeneous networks. 

**Experiment design**: 

Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: control condition vs social condition. They were asked to provide an answer to a question for three times (rounds):

- Participants in the control condition provided the answer independently for three times. 

- Those in the social condition answered independently in Round 1. In Round 2, they were shown the average answer of four other participants connected to them in a social network and then updated their answer. In Round 3, they were shown the average of the updated answers of four other participants connected to them (same in Round 2) and provided a final answer to the question. 

- A network consists of 35 participants who share the same political orientation (either Democrats or Republicans). Participants in the network **did not** know that other people in the network had the same partisan preference as theirs. 

- The researchers tested four questions. Each question was answered by 3 network groups and 1 control group for each political party. 

Results of Experiment 1: Information exchange in homogeneous networks increased accuracy for both party members and decreased belief polarization. 

Individual learning (being able to edit their answers in Round 2 and 3) was not the reason for increased accuracy because **the decrease in truth-centered mean (absolute distance from the mean) in the social group was significantly larger than that in the control group**. Therefore, the change should be attributed to information from others. 

Another possible reason is that the increased accuracy for groups as a whole obscured the decreased accuracy at an individual level, for example, when the standard deviation of truth-centered mean in a group increased. Results showed that for social groups, the standard deviation of responses in Round 3 was significantly smaller than that in Round 1. This change did not occur in the control group, indicating that **similarity within social groups increased**. 

**Replication study design** has some differences from Experiment 1:

1. More controversial questions;
2. Participants were required to confirm their political preference before participating in the study;
3. The experiment interface included an image of an elephant and a donkey;
4. The answer from four other connected participants were accompanied by their political orientation;
5. Subjects knew that they were participating in a study related to "Politics Challenge". 

Items 2 - 5 were partisan primes intended to "enhance the effects of partisan bias on social information processing" (p. 4).

Results of the replication study: same as in Experiment 1, social learning increased participants' answer accuracy for both Democrats and Republicans. Participants within each group became more similar over time. 

So, 

>... social learning is robust to partisan priming for both group-level improvement and individual improvement. 

But how about the difference between Democrats and Republicans? The above results showed "within group" changes but not between group changes. Results showed that between-group similarity also increased for participants in the social condition (37% for Experiment 1 and 46% for the replication study), which means that polarization decreased. 

**To recap**: social information exchange within homogeneous networks helped people make more accurate estimates. Similarity within and between groups increased, indicating that people within social groups got similar, and that polarization diminished. And this result withstood partisan priming. 

My question: Will the result stay the same if information exchange is not confined to numeric estimates? Why don't we allow people to chat? Is it because of lack of technical support or that there is theoretical consideration against it?

Conclusion: Homogeneous networks do not necessarily lead to polarization. In fact, polarization is decreased and accuracy increased. 

Then why do we still have polarized public opinions? This is because popular social media are centralized networks, which make influencers able to exert disproportionate effects on other people in the network. 

Future directions: 
- Any other reasons why "echo chambers" and polarization coexist in reality? 
- Is it possible to replicate this study in real-life networks? For example, in Facebook or Twitter, where information exchange is not limited to numeric estimates?
- How could we eliminate, or at least reduce the effects of influencers in a network, if ever possible?

Another experiment involves an 11-week fitness initiative among 800 graduate students at Penn. The experiment consisted of four groups:
  1. Group 1: Control group. Participants were allowed to sign up for fitness classes through an online portal. 
  2. Group 2: Same as the control group, but participants were also divided into groups based on their similarities. On the online portal, class attendance of anonymized "health buddies" was displayed. Communication with each was not possible.
  3. Group 3: Access to the online portal + groups based on similarities + communication between health buddies
  4. Group 4: Conditions in Group 3 with scores of other groups displayed on the portal. 

In Group 1 and 2, individuals completing the most classes were promised to get monetary rewards. In Group 3 and 4, health buddy groups completing the most classes got the monetary rewards. 

Results: 1). Exercise rate in group 2 & 4 were much higher; 2). Group 3 did worse than the control group.

- Even without digital tools to communicate with each other, rebel activities became more widespread in Syria. This is surprising because without telecommunication, Syrian rebels lost long ties that bridge groups far away from each other. That is, they had to rely on face-to-face communication to coordinate. How did it happen? When you get to understand that the way behaviors spread is different from that information diffuses, the answer will become clearer.

- Information, messages, and ideas spread like an epidemic whereas human behaviors don't. Contagions can be classified into two types: simple and complex. A single contact can start a simple contagion, but won't do the same for complex contagions, which involve efforts and costs, and require confirmation or reinforcement from multiple sources. 

- Long ties are enough for simple contagions whereas complex contagions favor wide ties. How wide should a tie be for a behavior to spread varies. If reputation is at stake, the threshold will be higher. That's where complex contagions are very different from simple ones. In simple contagions, hubs get infected early and then it spreads the infections to many others. In a complex contagion, however, hubs usually have reputation at stake, so they are less, rather than more, likely to get infected.

An interesting finding in this study is that after interacting with each other in social networks (which was limited to numeric estimates in the study), smokers and nonsmokers did not differ significantly in their perceptions of smokers' ability to understand health information associated with smoking.

Study design: 

1,600 people were recruited via Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk. There are 10 independent trials in the experiment. Each trial involves 160 participants who were randomly assigned to the following three groups:

1. Control group: 40 smokers / 40 non-smokers, so 80 people in each trail. 

2. Anonymous network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were embedded into a random social network that is decentralized and anonymous.

3. Informative network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were put into a social network where they could see the usernames and the smoking status of their four network neighbors. 

Procedure: 

Participants were shown an [anti-smoking advertisement](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227813.g002) and were asked to estimate the health risk of smoking by answering this question: How many people (in millions) are predicted to die from tobacco use in developed countries, in 2030? 

Participants were incentivized by monetary reward awarded based on the accuracy of their final answer. Changes in answers' accuracy were measured by the difference between Round 1 and Round 3. 

- Round 1: Participants in all groups provided the answer independently. 

- Round 2: Group 1 revised their estimates with independent reflection. Group 2 were shown the average response of their contacts and then revised their estimates. Group 3 were also shown the average response by their four contacts. They were also shown the usernames and the smoking status of their contacts. 

- Round 3: Same as in Round 2. 

Results:

- In Round 1, both smokers and nonsmokers were equally inaccurate at estimating the health risk of smoking;
- No significant improvement in estimated accuracy in the control group. 
- The decrease in estimate error in group 2 was significantly greater than both smoker and nonsmokers in the control group;
- The decrease in estimated error in group 3 was significantly greater than group 2. Specifically, this decrease is ten times greater than both smoker and nonsmoker in the control group.

>The more equity in people's social networks, the less biased and more informed groups will become--even when those groups start off with highly partisan opinions. 

- We believe that if we are put in a group consisting of like-minded people (so called "echo chambers"), we probably won't develop ideas that are on the opposite side of the spectrum. However, two social media experiments found the opposite results. In a study, Democrats and Republicans were put into "echo chambers", and discussed polarizing issues such as gun control, unemployment rate, and immigration. Both groups ended up moving toward a more moderate view of the topics. 

- In another study, smokers and nonsmokers estimated the risks of cigarette smoking. After the study, both groups had a more accurate understanding of the topic, and a higher opinion of the other group.

- Social media of our time exacerbates rather than eradicates partisan bias, because it's centralized, rather than egalitarian. In a centralized network, influencers filter or even block information. For example, if an influencer spreads a piece of wrong information, it might end up becoming an entrenched false belief in the whole community, whereas in an egalitarian network, each person has an equal say, and ideas are weighed by its own quality rather than the influence of the people behind them.

  - Link sampling: similar to node sampling, select randomly a bunch of links, and nodes attached to these links are included in the sample;

>In a more complete analysis, the multiverse of data sets could be crossed with the multiverse of models to further reveal the multiverse of statistical results. 

This is so true. I have several thoughts about this point:

First, it shows how arbitrary the choices in data processing and model picking are, and therefore, how arbitrary the statistical results might be. When I was doing research on selfies, I also had the same feeling. When I was doing the content analysis study comparing the differences in White women's selfies on Twitter and Chinese women's selfies on Weibo, I had to made so many arbitrary choices: whether to drop an item from a construct, whether to combine items, should I use a *t* test or nonparametric test, etc. 

Second, doing multiverse analysis reporting is very methodologically challenging. I cannot imagine a Master student after attending one statistics class doing a project involving more than 200 choice combinations. 

Finally, scholars will find it more difficult to cite others' studies. Right now, it's fairly easy to cite because almost all research papers generate a **certain** result. With multiverse analysis, almost all studies will involve many **uncertainties**. This complicates how people interpret the statistical results. 

That said, statistics is about **uncertainties**. It's certainly good to show these **uncertainties**. I think the science community, and the public, should be accustomed to seeing **uncertainties** in statistical results in the coming years.

The authors argued that "preregistration or blind analysis are not useful strategies for deflating the multiverse" (p. 709). I totally agree. I am not familiar with blind analysis, so I'll just talk about preregistration. As the authors noted, even if the study is preregistered, the result is still just one of the many possible choice combinations, albeit preregistered made. Therefore, the results of a preregistered study are still arbitrary, if the research involves arbitrary, or "whimsical" choices in data construction. 

The authors also talked about "model multiverse" at the end of the article.

[Fig. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/8/2389/F1.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1) shows the happiness distribution of words in each language, but how each word varies in their happiness score between languages. Google Translate is used. The result can be found in [Fig. 2](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/8/2389/F2.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1). As can be seen, the order changed a little bit, but the overall pattern remained. Spanish is the "happiest", and Chinese is the "saddest" (I highly doubt so, though).

Another interesting question to ask is whether a word's happiness score is associated with its frequency of use. As can be seen in [Fig. 3](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/8/2389/F3.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1). It turns out they are not associated.

PP.1-2

Purpose: To study the positivity of human language

Material: 24 corpora of 10 languages, including Chinese (simplified), Korean and Arabic

Measure: a word's importance is measured by its frequency

Procedure:

1. For each language, obtain the most frequently used words (around 10K)
2. Invite (and pay) native speakers to rate "how they felt in response to" (p.2390) each word on a 9-point Likert scale, with 1 representing the most negative or saddest, 5 neutral, and 9 the most positive or happiest. Each word receives 50 ratings, so there are 5 million human assessments in total. 

Results:

Implication-2. Seeing fewer friends' positive posts led people to produce fewer positive words in their own posts, rather than the opposite. 

### Drawbacks
- The effect size is quite small. 

### Thought
As the *Editorial Expression of Concern and Correction* said, it is "a matter of concern" that what we see on social media is to such a large extent manipulated by tech giants. As the study found, the content we see has an effect on our well-being. Even if they don't, users should be able to know what they are going through, rather than becoming a subject in an experiment we are ignorant of. 

## 2020-10-28 [Completed on 2020-10-29]
Continue with Kramer et al. (2014)

### Measurements & Measures
- To test the hypotheses, how are negativity and positivity measured: The percentage of the words as either positive or negative produced by a person.
- A check before running the experiment: all four groups did not differ in emotional expression in the week prior to the experiment. 
- Why using a weighted linear regression:  It was described in the Study Design that the chance of a post being omitted is not fixed. However, an effect was found that when people see fewer posts (i.e., more omission), they in turn posted fewer words. Therefore, we need to account for this effect by assigning weights to people. Specifically, people having more omission were given a higher weight in the regression. See details on p. 8789. 

### Results
Both H1 and H2 were supported. As can be seen in [the figure](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/24/8788/F1.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1), when negativity is reduced, people generate more positive words and fewer negative words, compared to the control group. The opposite pattern occurs when positivity is reduced. It shows that **emotions expressed by our friends through online social networks influenced our own mood status**.  

Some implications:
1. Direct interactions were not necessary for emotional contagion. 

## 2020-10-27
Continue with Kramer et al. (2014)

### Study design
- Why are two (separate) control conditions needed? Because the percentage (46.8%) of posts containing at least one positive word is much larger than that (22.4%) of posts containing at least one negative word. Suppose that for a person, 10% of his **positive** News Feed is omitted, and there is only **one** control group, what should be the corresponding percentage of a person's **random** News Feed being omitted in this control group? I don't know. Why? For example, if there are three people in experiment A (positivity reduction group), and their content reduction rate is 12%, 13%, and 14% respectively. Accordingly, we assume that the content reduction rate in the control group should be 12% times 46.8%, 13% times 46.8%, and 14% times 46.8%.  **No**. Why? Because there is also experiment B, whose content reduction rate might be different than that of experiment A. **Therefore, each experiment needs a separate control condition**.

### Hypotheses
- H1: If emotions are contagious via pure exposure to verbal expressions, then compared to their control group, Group A will be less positive, reflected by posting fewer positive content than before) and Group B will be less negative, reflected by posting fewer negative content than before).

- H2: "Opposite emotion should be inversely affected" (p. 8789): Group A should express increased negativity, and Group B should express increased positivity. 

### Thoughts
- It's interesting that in people's own status updates during the experimental period, only 3.6% were positive and 1.6% negative. However, for posts in people's News Feed, 46.8% were positive and 22.4% were negative. Why was it that News Feed posts were so much more **emotional** than people's own status updates? Is it because Facebook's algorithms like to show more emotional content to its users? I guess so. 

## 2020-10-26

Continue with Kramer et al. (2014)

### Why is this study needed?
Correlational studies cannot answer this question since it cannot support causality. Controlled experiments can support causality, but they have these problems:
  1. Exposure is not equal to interaction. In a controlled experiment, mood change might come from interacting with a happy/sad person, rather than simply being exposed to that person's mood;
  2. Nonverbal cues are unavoidable in a controlled experiment, thus making it impossible for us to disentangle the effect of verbal cues.

Therefore, this study makes unique contributions to answering this question. 

### Study design
- Two parallel experiments: In experiment A, people see less positive emotional content whereas in experiment B, people see less negative emotional content. Both had a control condition, in which posts had an equal chance (see below) of being omitted, randomly (i.e., without considering their emotional valence).
  - How much less? Good question! According to the authors, "each emotional post had between a 10% to 90% change (based on their User ID) of being omitted from their News Feed ..."
  - Well, how do you categorize a post as positive or negative? Awesome question. If a post contains at least one positive word as defined by LIWC2007, then it is a **positive** post. The same is for negative posts.

### Key question
The key question this paper was trying to answer: does exposure to mood expressed in the News Feed on FB change the content people post (that reflects their mood changes)? Or in the authors' own words, "whether exposure to verbal affective expressions lead to similar verbal expressions, a form of emotional contagion."

### What problems can these measures cause:

- Authors might 1) complicate their methods section so that it's difficult for reviewers to fault it; 2) hide results that do not fit with their arguments; 3) split the findings into multiple papers even if one paper is enough to cover all the results; 4) compress the results to meet the requirements of top journals like *Nature* or *Science*; 5) hype their work.

  - I would add one: p-hacking.
  - The point that authors might complicate their methods section resonates with me strongly. After reading papers each day for over 6 weeks, I felt that the methods section of some papers is so dense and complicated that, if I were the reviewer, I didn't have that much time and effort to decode it! This, I think, is really a problem. As I mentioned multiple times, I feel the most ideal studies are those with **simple methodology** and yet **impactful results**. A perfect example is Professor Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz's masterpiece of [*Collective dynamics of 'small world' networks*](http://materias.df.uba.ar/dnla2019c1/files/2019/03/watts-collective_dynamics-nature_1998.pdf).

- Students have fewer opportunities to learn and fail. Since publication is so important, group leaders may end up writing students' work. 

  - I don't think this is true in social sciences. 

- Scientists spend a large portion of their time networking, which might bring them more co-authors, and leave a positive impression on journal editors. 

## 2020-10-23

Lawrence, P. A. (2007).

### How science and scientists are assessed today:

- Impact factors: Journals are evaluated based on their impact factors. Schools, departments and scientists "are assessed according to the impact factors of the journals they published in" (p. R583). 

- Number of citations: Scientists are evaluated according to the number of citations their publications receive.

### Why these measures are flawed:

- Impact factors (IFs): IFs reflect how many times, on average, each paper in a given journal gets cited in the two years following its publication. There are two problems with this measurement: 1) IF is about the journal, not about your paper. Even if your paper is flawed, or even wrong, it's still something you can boast, if it gets published in a top journal; 2) Important findings may receive very few citations within two years since its publication. 

- Number of citations: 1) People may cite papers simply because of convenience or visibility, not because of the significance of the studies. Many people don't even need to read the papers they cite. 2) Because citations are so important these days, there might be unethical behavior involved. For instance, gatecrashing names by providing a reagent or data without actually participating in the study, or simply by power or authority. 

### What problems can these measures cause:

- Paper chase: Scientists spend so much time on writing and reviewing for, and submitting to top journals that they don't have much time left on solving scientific problems;

- Scientists will dodge uncharted areas and unpopular topics which are too risky.

Main takeaways:

- In the most productive countries, papers with women in dominant author positions, i.e., sole author, first author, and last author, are cited less than those with men in the same positions;

- South America and Eastern Europe had greater gender parity in terms of proportion of authorships. 

- Disciplines dominated by women all have to do with "care", for example, nursing; speech, language, and hearing; education.

- Natural sciences and humanities are dominated by men. Social sciences had a higher proportion of female authors. 

- "Female collaborations are more domestically oriented than are the collaborations of males from the same country"  (p. 213)


My issue: How did the authors assign gender to each author? It seems to me a very daunting task, especially when the names are of a non-Western origin.

Major takeaway: Big data research can learn from, and collaborate with small data research, which offers data that is not contained in big data. 

I started to think about my selfie studies. Specifically, I looked at 1) whether there are cultural differences between Chinese women's selfies on China's Weibo, and White Women's selfies on Twitter. For example, is it true that Chinese women focus on their face whereas White women focus on their body in their selfies? Do Chinese women's selfies show more cuteness? 

I also looked at 2) whether there are gender differences between men's selfies and women's selfies. For example, do women show more self-touching in selfies? 

I used a small-data approach. Although I downloaded over 30,000 images from Twitter and 8,000 images from Weibo, I only selected 200 from each platform for analysis, simply because I didn't have that much manpower to analyze them all. 

Talking about big data and small data research, I think I can combine the two here. Human content analysis can offer some insights and then directions for big data research. After all, there are so many things to detect in a selfie: the gender of the person, his or her mood, surroundings, posture, facial expressions, etc. Deep learning algorithms need some directions so that they can give us the analysis we need.

What are most of the data in research papers used for? To test theories. But theories arise from thinking, not data. Data is limited. It's extremely difficult for most scholars to get high-quality large-scale data. That shouldn't become a barrier to theoretical advances. Scholars who cannot get access to quality data can focus on theoretical thinking.

1. Within the unstructured condition, there are more non-obese adopters than obese adopter, both in terms of number and percentage;

2. Across conditions: homophily boosted adoption among both the obese (*P* < 0.01) and the non-obese people (*P* < 0.05), using Mann-Whitney U test. 

We can see that homophily had a significant effect on adoption of healthy behaviors. However, is it because obese people are more likely to be **exposed** to the behavior, or those who are exposed are more likely to adopt these behaviors in a homophilous group?

3. It turns out that within both conditions, the relative percentage of the obese and the non-obese **did not** differ significantly. 

4. Across conditions: homophily boosted both the number and the fraction of the obese who were exposed to the behavior (*P* < 0.05), using Mann-Whitney U test. This happened despite that obese people initially had greater exposure in the unstructured networks. 

5. Did homophily affect the adoption rate among those exposed? The effect was significant among the exposed obese people (*P* < 0.01), using Mann-Whitney U test, but not among the exposed non-obese individuals. 

I like this study: simple, and impactful.

### Literature
Homophily is defined as "the tendency of social contacts to be similar to one another". Although research on diffusion, and that on social influence differ over the effects of homophily on behavior spreading at the dyadic level, both agree that homophily decreases adoption at the network level. This is because, obviously, the more homophilous one's network is, he is less likely to be exposed to individuals of a different characteristic. If you are a less healthy person, and you find yourself in a homophilous network, it's less likely for you to be aware of what those healthy guys are doing. 

### Purpose
To study the effect of homophily on the adoption of healthy behavior

### Design
710 participants are randomly put into two conditions: homophilous population condition, and unconstructed population condition. The homophilous population condition consists of people having similar individual characteristics (gender, age, and BMI) whereas people in the other condition are random and mixed. 

All networks in the study have the same size (= 72), clustering coefficient (= 0.4), and degree distribution (= 6). The only difference is the level of homophily. 

The study consisted of five trials, each having two social networks. All these trials ran at the same time, for seven weeks. The healthy behavior to be adopted is to write a diet diary online. 

The seed of the behavior in all networks is a "healthy" individual. At the start of Week 1, the author activated the seed nodes simultaneously. Once an individual signs up, their neighbors will be notified via email. 

### Results
Across all five trials, people in homophilous condition had a higher adoption rate than those in unconstructed condition. 

Comparing adoption among obese and nonobese individuals: Within homophilous condition, a greater percentage of obese individuals adopted the behavior than that of nonobese people. In unconstructed condition, both the number of and percentage of nonobese adopters were larger than obese adopters. In fact, there was **no** obese adopters in the unconstructed group at all. 

Comparing the two conditions: homophily increased the adoption among both the obese and nonobese people. 

However, from these results, we cannot say for sure that **homophily** is the reason. For example, it may be that in the homophilous condition, obese people have more neighbors who sign up and thus have more exposure. It may also be because that homophily increases the likelihood for people to sign up once they are exposed. Therefore, we need to compare 1.) **exposure**, and 2.) **the likelihood to adopt once exposed** in the two conditions. 

It showed that, **within each of the two conditions**, the percentage of exposed obese people (num. of exposed obese / total num. of obese ppl) and that of exposed nonobese people (num. of exposed nonobese / total num. of nonobese ppl) do not differ significantly. **Across conditions**, homophily significantly increased the percentage of exposed obese people. See Fig. 2D.

How about the likelihood? **within conditions**, the likelihood to adopt after exposure was much higher for the obesed than for the nonobesed. **Acorss conditions**, homophily significantly increased obese people's likelihood to adopt after exposure. 

Therefore, homophily increased obese people's **access** to, and the **likelihood** to adopt healthy behavior. 

>... low adoption levels of health innovations among less healthy individuals may be a function of social environment rather than a baseline reluctance for adoption.

>Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. ‚Äî Chambliss, D. F. (p. 81)

### Excellence requires qualitative differentiation. 

Those who are more successful are doing **different** things, rather than **more of the same** things. Quantitative changes do bring success, but only **within** the world you are currently in. You cannot go to **another world** by doing more of what you have been doing. Those who are top performers are better to be seen as **different** rather than as **better**. 

### Talent is not the reason for excellence. 

1. First of all, factors other than talent predict success more precisely. 

2. Second, you cannot distinguish talent from its effects, i.e., you cannot realize there is talent until someone succeeds. 

3. Third, the amount of talent needed for excellence is surprisingly small. 

### Excellence is mundane.

1. Success is ordinary. Success is simply doing small tasks consistently and correctly.

**Note** : Below are the notes on 2020-10-04 

2. Motivation is also ordinary. Gold medalists did not think too far ahead. Instead, they focused on the most immediate goals, the so-called "small wins". For example, Steve Lundquist, who won two gold medals in swimming in the Los Angeles Olympics, set a goal that he would win every single swim in every single practice. **Small wins added up to excellence and success**. 

3. Don't take what you do as too important. You should maintain mundanity. If you are going to deliver a commencement speech in front of an audience of thousands, you should know that almost nobody cares about nor remembers what you have to say. When you are writing your doctoral thesis, you should also be aware that few people will read what you write.

There is a universal pattern for turn-taking. People aim to minimize gaps and overlap in conversations. 

- Slower:

  1. Nonanswer responses
  2. Disconfirmation responses
  3. Responses without a visible component (e.g., head nods shrugs, head shakes, blinks, or eyebrow flashes)

- Faster: Questions with gaze from the questioner

  - For both males and females, the cumulative distribution of the number of partners in the previous 12 months almost perfectly followed a straight line, indicating scale-free power-law characteristics;

  - For both genders, the cumulative distribution of the total number of sexual partners in the entire lifetime followed a straight line only when `$k > 20$`. 

  - The network of sexual partners is a scale-free one, meaning that you cannot assume, for example, 90% of the individuals have 3 - 10 partners. This is simply because there is no inherent scale. It's a crazy world, literally. I cannot believe that there are people who have over 100, even 1000 partners in their lifetime. Isn't this a crazy world?

Other notes:

  - Thanks to this paper, I now know that for a power-law distribution to show a straight line, I need to use CDF (cumulative distribution function)

  - One thing I didn't understand is how could the authors conclude that "the rich get richer" by simply looking at Figure 2a? I don't think it is a rigorous remark.

1. Del Vicario et al. (2016).

This paper is a little bit too technical for me, especially the second part that involves modeling. Also, I had difficulty understanding the conceptualization of "homogeneity" and "polarization".

Major takeaways from this paper:

  - Information on social media quickly reaches in 2 hours around 20% of the people it can reach in the end, and reaches in 5 hours around 40%. This is true for both science and rumors. 

  - Science news is usually quickly diffused. However, long-lasting interest doesn't correspond to the size of the interest. This means, even though people keep sharing it, not a lot of people will be interested in it. 

  - Conspiracy rumors diffused slowly and its cascade size is positively correlated with its lifetime. Meaning that the longer it lasts, the more people become interested in it.

This is the kind of study I admire: short, interesting, and impactful.

- Among 7 million distinct URLs shared by 10 million Facebook users in the US, 13% were hard news;

- Around 20% of a person's friends had the opposite political affiliation;

- Liberals had fewer friends who shared news from the other side;

- Controlling for the position of the news feed, it seemed conservatives were more likely to click on cross-cutting content, i.e., news that came from the other side; This result surprised me.

The work is indeed significant. It compared the spreading of true and false news on Twitter and concluded that the false spread faster, deeper, and farther than the truth. False political news, in particular, is diffused especially broadly and deeply. 

- Was it because those who spread the false were more influential or active?

Not really. Those who spread false news had fewer followers, followed fewer people on Twitter, were less likely to be verified, and had been on Twitter for less time. 

- Was it because false news was more noval and users are more likely to retweet information with more novelty?

  - False rumors were indeed more novel than the truth;
  - False news was objectively more novel, but did users get it? 
    - Yes, replies to false news showed greater surprise and disgust, whereas the truth inspired more sadness and joy. 

- Was it because of selection bias? I mean, the tweets from the six organizations might not be representative of all tweets. 
  - The authors verified a second sample of Tweets, which were labeled by three undergraduate students as true, false, or mixed. Again, the results were the same. 

- Did false news spread faster, deeper, farther, and more broadly because of bot activities? I mean, was it because of  bots that crazily retweeted and replied to false news?
  - Two bot-detection algorithms were applied independently to detect and remove bots before data analysis. Results were the same. This has significant implications: that false news traveled faster and farther not because of bots, but because of humans. 

### I had several issues:
1. Bad data visualization

At first glance, data visualization in this article is good. However, most of the figures used only red and green and therefore are not friendly to color-blinded people.

2. Content analysis

They should report Krippendorff's alpha rather than an agreement of 90%, I believe. 

3. No hypotheses beforehand

- Study goal: Study whether and how social network sites encourage recruitment in social movements.

- Why wasn't it published on *Nature* or *Science*: A first look at this paper made me feel that it should have published on *Nature* or *Science*. I believe the authors must have tried. After reading the whole paper, I concluded that lack of sufficient evidence might have been the reason why it didn't manage to do so. As the authors have mentioned in their limitations part, there were so many factors other than Twitter that influenced the movement in question, and it was impossible to single them out.

- Increasing partisan preferences in the US created a context for fake news to attract huge audiences;

- We don't know the exact ratio of fake news against real news, and we don't know the medium-to-long-run effect of exposure to fake news on people's attitudes. 

- Bots on social media are hard to detect. Once a detecting technique is developed, bots will upgrade themselves. 

- Possible interventions:

  1. Encouraging people to use fact checking. However, we are not sure whether this is useful or not, partly due to people's confirmation bias and desirability bias. 
  2. Internet oligopolies should collaborate with academia to understand how pervasive fake news is. Also, these oligopolies' power should be contained by, for example, legal systems.

- Definition:
  - Computational social science: language, location, movement, networks, images, and video, using statistical models that capture multifarious dependencies.

- Problems
  1. Interdisciplinary research not encouraged enough, especially that involve cooperation between social and computer scientists, due to unfavorable policies at universities;
  2. Proprietary data unavailable to researchers.
  3. Available data is not intended for research and won't be shared with other researchers, which impedes reproducibility.
  4. Lack of regulatory guidance from university IRBs about collecting and analyzing sensitive data. 

- Recommendations
  1. Collaborate and negotiate with private companies for data;
  2. Build infrastructures that provide data as well as preserve participants' privacy;
  3. Develop new ethical guidelines;
  4. Reorganize universities so that 1) multi-disciplinary collaboration is professionally or financially rewarded, and 2) enforce ethical research
  5. Researchers make sure that they do public good.

2. Recapping Centola (2010):

- Contribution: An experimental design that ran contrary to previous findings regarding the strength of weak ties. 
- Conclusion: networks with local clustering are conducive to behavioral diffusion. 
- Method: An experiment with two groups. One group found themselves in a random network, and the other group in a clustered-lattice network. **Degree distribution of the two networks is identical**.
- Why could it be published on *Science*: Maybe the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of network topology on behavior spreading.
- My question: I didn't see many long ties in the "small-world network" in Figure 1.
- Improvements: I didn't know all of the statistical tests used in this paper. I know the Mann-Whitney U test but I don't know Kolmogorov-Smirnov. I am wondering whether the study could be conducted using Bayesian statistics.

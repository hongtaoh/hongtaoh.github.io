2. Recapping Centola (2010):

- Contribution: An experimental design that ran contrary to previous findings regarding the strength of weak ties. 
- Conclusion: networks with local clustering are conducive to behavioral diffusion. 
- Method: An experiment with two groups. One group found themselves in a random network, and the other group in a clustered-lattice network. **Degree distribution of the two networks are identical**.
- Why could it be published on *Science*: Maybe the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of network topology on behavior spreading.
- My question: I didn't see many long ties in the "small-world network" in Figure 1.
- Improvements: I didn't know all of the statistical tests used in this paper. I know Mann-Whitney U test but I don't know Kolmogorov-Smirnov. I am wondering whether the study could be conducted using Bayesian statistics.

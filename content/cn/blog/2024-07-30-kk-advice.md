Don't be the best. Be the only. 

不是问反馈，而是问建议

你可以说不，甚至不需要说明理由

施舍越多，你得到的也越多。这是宇宙法则

你只需要去打卡。99%的成功单纯是你坚持下来了

不要着急。

>When crises strike, don't waste them. No problems, no progress. 

>You really don't want to be famous. Read the biography of any famous person. 

当一个人去世，参加追悼会的人不会谈论逝者有什么成就，而是谈论他/她是一个什么样的人。

>To be hired, think like your boss. 

You are what you spend your time on. 

Master something. 

>Outlaw the word "you" during domestic arguments. 

>Train employees well enough that they could get another job, but treat them well enough that they never want to. 

>The greatest rewards come from working on something nobody has words for. If you possibly can, work where there are no names for what you do. 

You don't need more time. You just need more focus. 

严于律己 宽以待人

>If you can avoid seeking the approval of others, your power is limitless. 

>Work for something much larger than yourself. 

>If you can't tell what you desperately need, it's probably sleep. 

>Act out the change you seek. 

保持缄默。

>If your goal does not have a scheduel, it is a dream. 

>Don't ever work for someone you don't want to become. 

>What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days. 

>Make stuff that is good for people to have.

>Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks even if you believe it is not deserved. 

>If you are doing something that you are hiding from others, it's probably not good for you. 

>We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade. 

对于孩子，把你觉得要在孩子身上花的钱减半，但是把你原本打算在孩子身上花的时间翻倍。

不用专注于目的地，你只需要保持正确的方向，你就会达到目的地。

Always back up your data. 

>Don't bother fighting the old, just build the new. 

>You are as big as the things that make you angry. 

>Focus on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems. 

Steady production. 

The small person believes they are suprior; the suprior person knows they are lucky. 

>Unhappiness comes from wanting what others have; happiness comes from wanting what you already have. 

假设别人记不住你的名字。即使你刚介绍过自己，再次见面时请再说一下你叫什么。

>What you do instead of work might become your real work. 

>When you find something you really enjoy, do it slowly. 

>It is impossible for you to become poor by giving. It is impossible for you to become wealthy without giving. 

完成比完美重要。

>The easy choice pays off right away. The best choice will pay off at the end. 

Ask your child whom they helped today. 

Spend 15 mins each day on improving the way you do your things.

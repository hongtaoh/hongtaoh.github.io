<!-- The following is what the bookdown has originally. It means that "if this list is not the homepage, show its title. "
{{if not .IsHome }}
<h1>{{ .Title | markdownify }}</h1>
{{ end }}
I don't want to show titles of lists, even if it is not the homepage, so I decided not to use the code here. You might ask why I don't like showing the title for non-homepages, I guess it is because the title will be in plural forms. I am wondering HOW CAN I MAKE IT INTO A SINGULAR FORM.-->

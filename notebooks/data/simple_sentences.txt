the cat sits on the mat
the dog runs in the park
a bird flies over the house
the cat eats the fish
the dog chases the cat
a man walks to the store
the woman reads a book
a child plays with the ball
the sun shines in the sky
the moon rises at night
the cat sleeps on the bed
the dog barks at the bird
a fish swims in the water
the man eats an apple
the woman drinks the water
a boy runs to the school
the girl sits on the chair
the bird sings in the tree
the cat watches the mouse
the dog digs in the garden
a woman walks in the park
the man reads the paper
a child eats the bread
the sun sets in the west
the moon shines at night
the cat jumps on the table
the dog sleeps in the house
a bird sits on the branch
the man walks to the park
the woman eats the apple
a boy plays in the garden
the girl reads a book
the fish hides in the rock
the cat runs to the door
the dog watches the cat
a man sits on the bench
the woman walks to the store
a child drinks the milk
the sun rises in the east
the stars shine at night
the cat hides under the bed
the dog runs to the man
a bird flies to the tree
the man drinks the coffee
the woman sits on the bench
a boy walks to the park
the girl plays with the doll
the mouse runs from the cat
the cat catches the mouse
the dog eats the meat
a woman reads the paper
the man plays with the child
a fish jumps in the water
the sun shines on the house
the moon hides in the clouds
the cat sits by the window
the dog barks at the man
a bird eats the seed
the man runs in the park
the woman walks to the house
a boy sits on the grass
the girl drinks the juice
the bird flies over the park
the cat sleeps by the fire
the dog plays with the ball
a man eats the bread
the woman watches the bird
a child runs to the house
the stars hide in the clouds
the moon rises over the hill
the cat jumps to the chair
the dog sits by the door
a bird sings on the branch
the man walks by the river
the woman eats the fish
a boy plays with the dog
the girl sits by the window
the mouse hides in the wall
the cat watches the bird
the dog chases the ball
a woman drinks the tea
the man sits by the fire
a fish swims to the rock
the sun sets over the sea
the clouds float in the sky
the cat runs in the house
the dog sleeps on the mat
a bird flies in the sky
the man eats the meat
the woman reads by the fire
a boy runs in the garden
the girl eats an apple
the bird sits by the water
the cat plays with the mouse
the dog watches the man
a man walks by the sea
the woman plays with the child
a child sits on the grass
the sun shines on the water
the moon sets in the west
the cat drinks the milk

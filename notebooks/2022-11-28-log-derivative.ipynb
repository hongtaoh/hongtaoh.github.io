    "According to the definition of derivative, we know that the derivative of $f(x) = 2^x$ should be:\n",

    "$$\\lim_{dx \\to 0}\\frac{2^{x+dx} - 2^x}{dx} = \\lim_{dx \\to 0}\\frac{(2^{dx} - 1) \\cdot 2^x}{dx}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we know that as $dx$ approaches $0$, $\\frac{2^{dx} - 1}{dx}$ is approaching a constent ($ln(2)$). That is to say, the derivative of $f(x) = 2^x$ is $2^x$ itself multiplied by a constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we wonder, is there a case where the drivatie of $f(x) = t^x$ is itself? That is to say, when will the constant be $1$? And that is the definition of $e$! We stipulate that if the derivative of $f(x) = t^x$ is $t^x$ itself, then we denote that special $t$ with $e$."

    "We have $n$ which is approaching $0$, and $\\frac{1}{n}$ approaching positive infinity. Since $m = \\frac{dx}{x}$, and $dx$ is approaching $0$, so $m$ is approaching $0$ and $\\frac{1}{m} = \\frac{x}{dx}$ is approaching positive infinity. Therefore, we can say with certainty that as $dx$ approaches $0$, ${(m + 1)}^{\\frac{1}{m}}$ is approaching $e$. Thus, ${ln(m + 1)}^{\\frac{1}{m}}$ is approaching 1. Therefore, $f^\\prime(x)$ is approaching $\\frac{1}{x}$, which means that **the derivative of the natural log function is $\\frac{1}{x}$**."

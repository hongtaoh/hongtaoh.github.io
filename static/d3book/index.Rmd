# Why did I build this website?{-}

D3 is hard, literally. Its learning curve is very steep. The key to mastering it, I believe, is to **practice and keep practicing**. I found Scott Murray's [D3 book](https://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e) easy to understand, and very useful. To make the best of the book, however, it's very crucial to practice on your own, rather than just reading the book. Reading others' codes won't make you a good programmer. 

Therefore, I documented the codes' objectives in the book, i.e., what the codes in the book aimed to achieve. Then I used these prompts to train myself. I found them useful so I decided to share these prompts through this website.

If you can achieve all of what these prompts asked you to do, then you don't need to read the whole book again.

 - interaction between humans, warning system, and driving system

 - driving is a complex human-computer interaction. Even in the age of autonomous driving, at least two interactions will happen: 1) between AVs and pedestrains; 2) between AVs and the passangers. Two other interactions might also happen: 1) between AVs and the driving and 2) between AVs and other system professionals, such as warning system, traffic control system

- external human-machine interfaces
  - In the age of AVs, there is no communication between the driver and road users. If the driver is there, we can have eye contact, but with AVs, that's not possible. So how can we enable communication between the road users and the vehicle?
  - Idea: maybe we can use chatgpt to communicate with the driver? But how can chatgpt be integrated into the AV?

  - How can we improve the trust of pedestrains in AVs?
  - Idea: I thought about how can we improve the trust between AVs, between AVs and road users, and between AVs and possible drivers/operators.

  - take-over warning system. When there are dangerous situations on the road, the AV will warn the driver and let him take the car over. But how to design this warning system? Display a message only?

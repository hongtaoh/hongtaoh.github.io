# 1.Key Question

Do Chinese women’s selfies on Weibo `r fa("weibo", fill="red")` and White women’s selfies on Twitter `r fa("twitter", fill="steelblue")` differ?

# 2. Background

- Beauty of women in the US was constructed in terms of the **body**, whereas East Asian women care more about their **facial features** [^1].

- “Sexual/sex kitten” appeared significantly more frequently in American ads than in East Asian ads.[^2]

- Studies on cuteness in Asian context focused on adults, whereas those in Western context focused on infants.[^3]

Yihui [documented](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html) figure referencing very well. There is only one thing I need to add: do remember to add a figure caption if you want to reference it. 

For example, if we have a chunk label without a figure caption:

```{r first-label}
plot(pressure)
```

We cannot reference it: Figure \@ref(fig:first-label). 

This is because without a figure caption, the figure won't be numbered. Without a number, the figure cannot be referenced. 

Simply adding a figure caption solves the problem:

```{r second-label, fig.cap="temperature-pressure"}
plot(pressure)
```

Now we can reference it: Figure \@ref(fig:second-label)
